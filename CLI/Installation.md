The CLI is currently supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.

##Installation Instructions ##

JD Cloud CLI is developed based on Python language and JD Cloud Python SDK. Please install Python 2.7 before using the CLI. * Version. Visit, download, and install the Python 2.7. * Version from the official website.

The JD Cloud Python SDK does not have to be installed manually, and the Python package administration tool automatically downloads and installs the corresponding version of the dependency package. If you have installed the JD Cloud Python SDK and do not work properly because the CLI version does not correspond to it, refer to the version correspondence table in the “CLI use instructions”, install the corresponding version, or delete the old Python SDK and reinstall the CLI.
