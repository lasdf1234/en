# Create API Groups

API group is the fundamental management unit of API. SDK is generated based on this API group. Create the API group and then create the API under the group.
- The group possesses Region attribute. Determine the Region before the API selects the group and no alternation is allowed once generation.
- Based on API group, the user needs to configure the traffic control policy, authorization access, backend signature and customized domain names based on the group.
