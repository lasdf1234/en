# Access Authorization for API

The process of access authorization of API means that the API provider authorizes API caller to access the API group. The authorization process is divided into two parts:

- API caller creates and provides **Access Key **. The access key (APIKey/APISecret) represents the identity of the requester.

- API provider authorizes the API group to API caller.

When the customer of API provider or he needs to test the API calling, it is necessary to create the access key as the identity of requester, and then the API provider authorizes the API group to API caller during the access authorization.

Then, it will be explained in two parts:


## Operational Steps
### API caller creates and provides **Access Key** 
#### STEP1: Click the **Access Key** at left menu to enter the page of access key list

#### STEP2: Click **Create Access Key**

- After creation of key pair, the system will automatically generate access key ID, API key and API Secret.
- API caller needs to inform the **APIKey** to API provider, and then the provider perform the authorized access.


### API provider authorizes the API group to API caller

#### STEP1: API provider obtains the Access Key ID of API caller or the Access Key of JD Cloud account.

API caller can find the access key ID in the access key details page and tell this ID to API provider.

 API caller can request the authorized calling through AK (Access Key) method of JD Cloud. Specifically, the caller can redefine or select an AK in the Access Key management page and tell this AK to API provider.
