# 1 Introduction
This document describes the interface definition that the third-party applications need to implement to access to JD Cloud Marketplace. After the customer purchases goods in JD Cloud Marketplace, JD Cloud Marketplace will send the information of the goods and account information of the buyer to the service provider by calling the interface provided in this document. The service provider can obtain the information of ordering, renewal, expiration and discontinuation. At the same time, the service provider processes the buyer information according to the information. All interfaces involved in the document are called in HTTP GET and the message is transmitted in JSON format.
# 2 Scope
Software applications generally have independently accessible website. Customers do not need to purchase independent cloud resources, and can register, log in, and operation functions on the website through the Internet. Selection of commodity access type application software:

# 3 Security
3.1 Description
To ensure the communication security between JD Cloud Marketplace and third-party applications, the Cloud Marketplace will add a token as a security token each time it calls the application interface. After receiving the request, the application interface generates a token value according to the generation rule and compares it with the token value obtained in the interface parameter, and it will pass the validation if the value is the same. The token value is composed of the parameters passed each time and the key assigned by the Cloud Marketplace to the service provider.
3.2 Key value acquisition
Obtained from the Service Management Backend (http://i-market.jdcloud.com/) Information Management > Basic Information page.

3.3 Token value generation
3.3.1 Description
The token value is the security check parameter between the Cloud Marketplace and the service provider, and the Cloud Marketplace will have a token value in every parameter each time it calls the provider interface. The service provider generates a token value according to the generation rule and compares it with the token value obtained in the interface. It will pass the validation if the value is the same.

 3.3.2 Generation rules

Take all the parameters except the token in each http get request parameter, perform dictionary sorting on the parameter name, add &key=[isv key value] at the end of the sorted character string, and then encrypt the entire character string by md5 encryption The encrypted string is used as the token value.

3.3.3 Example
l Example of a request received by a service provider:
http://www.isvwebsite.com?p1=1&p2=2&p3=3&token=xxxx                

2 Sorting operation: no url encode
sort（P1，P2，P3）；                

3 Token value: URLEncoder.encode (character string after splicing, "utf-8");
“p1=1&p2=2&p3=3&key=isvkey”.toMD5()

The document has the instance code at the end.

Test key:

qweqeqeqe123123123131

 

Test parameter:

accountNum=1&action=createInstance&email=bujiaban%40jd.com&expiredOn=2018-06-30+23%3A59%3A59&jdPin=bujiaban&mobile=&orderBizId=444181&orderId=556596&serviceCode=FW_GOODS-500232&skuId=FW_GOODS-500232-1&template=&token=9512df22a941f172a9f28068b758ee3e
# 4 Interface description
l If the customer purchases the product and the payment is successful, the Cloud Marketplace will call the interface to notify the service provider of the purchase information and customer information.

2 The service provider needs to return the delivery instance unique ID (instanceId) corresponding to this order. It is recommended that this ID directly use the orderBizId passed in the Cloud Marketplace.

3 Please do not block this interface. If it takes a long time, you can use the queue to buffer, set instanceId=0, and then return immediately. If the operation fails, please set instanceId=0, the Cloud Marketplace will call again until a valid instanceId is obtained. If the valid instanceId has not been obtained, the Cloud Marketplace will continue to call 200 times and then stop calling. If the service provider interface problem has been resolved, you need to request the call again. Please log in to the service provider management backend (http://i-market. Jcloud.com/)--Transaction Management—Click “Reset Instance” in the order record query page. When instanceId=0 or exception, the interface may be called multiple times. If it is called repeatedly, please ensure the idempotency of the interface.

Note: Orders generated by the service sold by quantity will call the interface multiple times according to the purchase quantity. The orderBizId will be different. Please return a delivery instance for each call.
4.1 New purchases
4.1.1 Description
l After the user places an order and pays successfully, Cloud Marketplace calls the new service interface, and the user information and order information are transmitted. The service provider performs the delivery action in its system according to the parameters passed in, and returns the instance information to the Cloud Marketplace through the Json format. After the Cloud Marketplace receives the return value, it saves the information and feeds it back to the user. The interface call process is as follows:

1. The return value of the service provider needs to contain the unique ID (instanceId) of the instance created by this order. It is recommended that this ID directly use the orderBizId passed in the Cloud Marketplace.

2. Please do not block this interface. If it takes a long time, you can use the queue to buffer, set instanceId=0, and then return immediately. If the operation fails, please set instanceId=0, the Cloud Marketplace will call again until a valid instanceId is obtained.

3. The interface may be called multiple times. If it is called repeatedly, please ensure the idempotency of the interface.
