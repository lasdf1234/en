# Listener management

## Add listener

1. Enter the listener management page by clicking the Load balancer-Details-Listener;

2. Click Create a listener to open a listener setting page;

3. Listener setting:
	
	Frontend listening configuration:
	
	- Select Frontend Listening Protocol: http, https, tcp; port: 1-65535;	
		Note: The listening port under the same load balancer cannot be duplicated, after creating the listener, the Listening Protocol, port cannot be allowed to modify;	
	- Idle connect timeout: input range 1-86400s;

	**Backend forwarding configuration:**

	- Backend service by fault: Create or select an existed backend service, after selecting an existed backend service, relevant parameters cannot be modified;
	
		 Backend service name: define backend service name, backend services created synchronously with listeners can be viewed in the backend service list;	
	
	- Backend Protocol: Display by default, if the listening protocol is http, https, the backend protocol is http, if the listening protocol is tcp, the backend protocol is tcp;
	
	- Port: Backend business forwarding port, input range 1-65535, ports for different backend services can be duplicated;
	
	- Scheduling algorithm: Weighted round robin algorithm, weighted least connection number and source IP can be selected according to actual business needs;
	
		 Session persistence: Off by default, which supports cookie session persistence based on cookie implant method when Backend Protocol is http;	
	
		 cookie timeout: input range 0-86400, default value 0, representing the same life cycle as the browser;	
	
	- Get real IP: It is on by default when Backend Protocol is http, support to pass-through in proxyprotocol Protocol method when Backend Protocol is tcp;
	
		Note: If it is gotten by turning on source IP under tcp protocol, it needs to be separately configured at the server;	
		
	- Get http header field: May select multiple items such as X-Forwarded-Proto, XForwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-LBIP, X-Forwarded-Host for passing-through relevant information requested by client http;

	**Health check setting:**

	- Select health check method: HTTP and TCP;
	
	- Set check port: input range 1-65535, if it is not filled in, the port of backend instance for receiving load balancer traffic will be the port by default;
	
	- Response timeout time(s): input range 2-60s, which is the maximum timeout time for health check response;
	
	- Health check interval(s): input range 5-300s, which is the maximum time interval for health check;
	
	- Unhealthy threshold: input range 1-5, which is the number of consecutive health check failures from success to failure of the backend instance;
	
	- Healthy threshold: input range 1-5, which is the number of consecutive health check successes from failure to success of the backend instance;
	
	- Normal state code: input range 2xx (equivalent to 200-299), 3xx (equivalent to 300-399), 4xx (equivalent to 400-499);
	
	- Check path: It only will be filled in when the health check method is HTTP, it must start with “/”, at most support 5-level contents, and cannot exceed 100 characters.

	**Add server group: **

	- Select server group type: virtual server, availability group, or it cannot be added currently;
	
		 Virtual server group: The system will automatically filter out the list of server groups that can be associated now, if there is no available server group, it may click “Create a new virtual server group” to create;	
	
		Note: The backend instances in the optional server group must be under the same region, virtual private cloud, and availability zone as the load balancer.

	- Availability Group: The system will automatically filter out the availability groups that can be associated now, if there is no availability group, please go to the Availability Group page to create; note: The backend instances in the optional availability group must be under the same region, virtual private cloud, and availability zone as the load balancer.

# Manage listener

1. View listening details: Click details in the listener list page-action bar to view details of listener;

2. Enable/Disable listener: Enable/disable the listener via the listener list page-action bar;

3. Edit listener: The content of listener can be edited by the listener list page-action bar (for details, refer to the text below);

4. Delete listener: The listener can be deleted by the listener list page-action bar.

## Edit listener

1. Certificate: The certificate associated to the listener can be modified, if any;

2. Idle connection timeout: Revisable;

3. Default backend service by fault: Able to replace new backend service. Note: Only the backend service matched to the listener protocol is selected. For example, if the listening protocols are http and https, the backend service with the backend protocol of http can be selected. If the listening protocol is tcp, the backend service with the backend protocol of tcp can be selected.

4. Modification to other parameter items is not supported.
