## Streaming Data Bus Overview<br>
The Streaming Data Bus is a scalable, distributed, high-throughput messaging service for big data scenarios, providing low-latency message publish and subscribe function to help users quickly build the analysis and applications of streaming data. <br>
<br>
The streaming data bus is capable of receiving and processing millions of data and messages per second, and can store and process data sent to the streaming data bus by distributed software and devices, and due to the ability to provide publish / subscribe function at a low latency and on a very high scale, the stream data bus can serve as a data service entry of the big data, and the data collected in the stream data bus can be consumed and used by the downstream service application, such as real-time data processing by stream computing products; meanwhile, the data stored in the streaming data bus can be stored in JD Cloud Storage, data warehouse and other products for persistent storage of data for future analysis. <br>
<br>
**What can the streaming data bus be used for:**
<br>
Streaming data centers can track data in the Internet of Things, collect user click stream logs from web sites, capture in-game events on TV or in games, or collect IoT data from industrial machines, interconnected cars, or other devices. <br>
<br>
**Benefits from using streaming data bus:**<br>
Putting data into the streaming data bus ensures persistence and resiliency. The latency between the time the record is placed in the stream and the time the record can be consumed is typically less than 1 second, which means that you can start using the data in the streaming data bus almost immediately after adding the data. At the same time, the flexibility of the streaming data bus allows you to expand or shrink the stream so that you never lose them before the data records expire. <br>
