### **Overview**

Through this teaching, you can complete the deployment of a VM that can communicate with the public network in JD Cloud and obtain the following resources:

- 1 VPC
- 1 Subnet
- 1 VM
- 1 Public IP

## ** Operating steps**

### **Step 1: Create VPC**

- Click Network -> VPC -> VPC in the menu on the left side of the menu in sequence, enter the VPC list page, click Create, and the Create Configuration window pops up.
- Select the region based on your demands, fill in the name, fill in CIDR, and click Create to get a VPC.
