- Configure Routing

According to the actual network resource planning of the connected network, configure the subnet route and point the next hop to the machine where the VPN gateway resides. Note that the subnet needs to be planned in advance. The machine that needs to communicate through the VPN cannot be in the same subnet as the machine that is the VPN gateway, and the subnet cannot be associated to the same routing table.
