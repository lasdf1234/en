## Product Advantages

### Borderless

JD Cloud VPC does not have to preset CIDR so as to support the situation that service expansion disrupts the original network planning.



### Securely Isolated Customized Network

JD Cloud provides a securely isolated virtual private network. Different VPCs are completely isolated, and users can customize the range of VPC network segment and configure subnet, route table, ACLs etc. in VPC independently.



### Flexible Subnet Route Policy

JD Cloud provides route policies that can be flexibly configured to enable edition of subnet-based route policy and precise control of network traffic to and from the subnet.



### Multiple Security Protection

JD Cloud provides subnet-level ACL security policy configuration and instance-level security group policy to ensure double network security.



### IP Resource Sharing

JD Cloud provides elastic EIP functions, which can flexibly bind and unbind multiple resources.



### Support Multiple Composite Networking Modes

JD Cloud VPC supports a variety of composite networking modes, such as using VPN to connect enterprise IDC and JD Cloud intranet, or connect enterprise data center and JD Cloud VPC export through dedicated Line connection.

| :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| ** Independent planning ** | Users can customize the range of VPC or even do without presetting CIDR of VPC as requirements, independently subnet network segments and edit route table. Panoramically restore the network environment before connected to cloud to realize complete and independent management of the network environment. |
| **High Availability** | VPC uses a highly available and expandable architecture such as route, load balancer, BGW and dedicated line to ensure high network availability. |
| **Security and reliability** | Implement security group primary protection at the instance level, implement network ACL secondary protection at the subnet level and implement network security isolation between VPCs to achieve the goal of seamless access control for the entire network resources. |
| **Good expandability ** | Implement inter-regional/cross-regional VPC interoperability conveniently to enable interoperability of different service scenarios or cross-regional disaster tolerance. Connect customer IDC with JD Cloud VPC to implement a composite cloud solution. |
