##### Basic Information:
	
- Name: define backend service name;
	
- Backend protocol: optional tcp 【note: if the backend protocol is tcp, only the listener with tcp listening protocol can be associated】;

- Port: The input range is 1-65535 and ports for different backend services can be duplicated;

- Scheduling algorithm: Support weighted round robin algorithm, weighted least connection number and source IP;

- Session persistence: it is closed by default, open to support the TCP-based session persistence, and the default is 1440 seconds;

- Connection draining: Configure the connection draining timeout period, the range is [0, 3600] seconds, and the default is 300 seconds.

- Response timeout time(s): input range 2~60s, which is the maximum timeout time for health check response;

- Health check interval(s): input range 5~300s, which is the maximum time interval for health check;

- Unhealthy threshold: input range 1~5, which is the number of consecutive health check failures from success to failure of the backend instance;

- Healthy threshold: input range 1~5, which is the number of consecutive health check successes from failure to success of the backend instance;

- Normal state code: input range 2xx (equivalent to 200-299), 3xx (equivalent to 300-399), 4xx (equivalent to 400-499);

- Check path: It only will be filled in when the health check method is HTTP, it must start with “/”, at most support 5-level contents, and cannot exceed 100 characters.

- Availability Group: The system will automatically filter out the availability groups that can be associated now, if there is no availability group, please go to the Availability Group page to create} 【Note: The backend instances in the optional availability group must be under the same region, virtual private cloud, and availability zone as the load balancer.】 .
