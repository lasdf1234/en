- Response timeout time(s): input range 2~60s, which is the maximum timeout time for health check response;

- Health check interval(s): input range 5~300s, which is the maximum time interval for health check;

- Unhealthy threshold: input range 1~5, which is the number of consecutive health check failures from success to failure of the backend instance;

- Healthy threshold: input range 1~5, which is the number of consecutive health check successes from failure to success of the backend instance;

- Normal state code: input range 2xx (equivalent to 200-299), 3xx (equivalent to 300-399), 4xx (equivalent to 400-499);
