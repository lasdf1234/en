Currently, invoices are divided into three types: individual general VAT invoice, enterprise general VAT invoice, and enterprise special VAT invoice.

## Description
Individual general VAT invoice and enterprise general VAT invoice may be directly saved after invoice title modification for your application for invoice issuance.

Invoice information of enterprise special VAT invoice shall be filled in after passing the qualification audit, and shall be audited accordingly after being filled in. We will complete the audit on enterprise special VAT invoice information within 1-2 working days.

Enterprise special VAT invoices are issued to general taxpayers. Information related to special invoice (taxpayer identification number, account information opened with bank of deposit, registered address and phone number, etc.) shall be provided for application, and deductions for input tax are allowed for invoices issued. If general taxpayer qualification is not obtained, please select “individual/enterprise general VAT invoice”.

Individual/enterprise general VAT invoices are issued to small-scale taxpayers, and deductions for input tax are not allowed for such invoices issued. If general taxpayer qualification is obtained, and deductions for input tax is needed, please select “enterprise special VAT invoice”, and apply for invoice after filling in your invoice information and mailing information. (If you need to apply for enterprise special VAT invoice, you must confirm that the invoice information has passed the audit.)

Special VAT invoices have a 180-day limit for deduction period, and invoice will not be reissued after 180 days from the invoice date.

2. Enter into 【Cost Management】-【Invoice Management】-Invoice List, and click “Apply for Invoice” to enter into application page for invoice issuance;
