# Renewal management
## Resource Renewal of single set
When the user makes the independent renewal action to a single paid resource, the resource expiration time will be updated after the user selects the renewal period and successfully renews the resource. The resource billing type can be changed to be the monthly package in the renewal process by configuring the billing resources.

There are two renewal methods available:

1. The resource renewal actions are made in the resource management console;
2. The resource renewal actions can be made to the selected resources in the [Renewal Management](https://renewal-console.jdcloud.com/renew) page.

The renewal management page supports resource screening based on resource region, expiration time range, resource billing type, etc., thus facilitating your search.

## Resource renewal in batches
The renewal in batches refers to that the same resources with the billing type of monthly package are renewed. In the renewal in batch process, the user can make the renewal action to the resources with relevant association relationship. The resource expiration time can be updated after successful renewal when the user selects the renewal period.

The resource renew actions can be made to the selected resources in the [Renewal Management](https://renewal-console.jdcloud.com/renew) page. When there are many resources, you can select all resources of different pages and submit the renewal action in batches.

## Automatic Renewal
 The renewal setting function is provided to the user for the purchased monthly package resource intended to be used for a long period.

You can implement the automatic renewal setting for the monthly package resources in the [Renew Management](https://renewal-console.jdcloud.com/renew) page.

1. Automatic renewal supports setting, modification and cancellation. For the resources for which the automatic renewal function has been canceled, we will recover the normal expiration check and remind to such resources.

2. For the resources for which the automatic renewal function has been set, it will be extended to corresponding period by automatic renewal according to the renewal term selected by the user after the resources are expired.

3. The charge will be withheld 7 days (natural day) before the service expiration day for the automatic renewal and the real-time bill will be provided. Please view the bill in the “Purchases Record” page.

4. If the withholding is failed for automatic renewal, the withholding will be made for the automatic renewal at 08:00AM per day until the service expiration date or until such withholding is successful. If the available balance in your account is insufficient, the automatic renewal will be disabled. Please be sure to keep sufficient balance in your account.

5. The automatic renewal is not available to the expired resources.

6. If the automatic renewal function is enabled and the renewal is made by the user manually, the automatic renewal can be enabled on the expiration time of the manual renewal.
