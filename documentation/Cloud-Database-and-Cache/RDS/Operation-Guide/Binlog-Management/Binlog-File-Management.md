# Binlog File Uploading
The Binlog file records the transaction information of the instances and is the basis for MySQL/Percona service instance HA architecture, availability and restorability.
MySQL/Percona service instance automatically synchronizes Binlog files to cloud storage on a regular basis and cleans up the local Binlog files after 48 hours, at which point the instance's local storage space can be freed for other uses.
If the instance generates a large number of Binlog files in a short period of time, users can use the ***One-click Uploading of Binlog***  function provided by the console to actively synchronize the Binlog files to the cloud storage, and clean up the local Binlog files.

## Precautions
* At present, JD Cloud does not charge for the space occupied by Binlog files.
* You can clean up all local Binlog files before the last backup of the instance after actively uploading Binlog files by one click.
