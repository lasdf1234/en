# Backup Local Database

## 1. Check Database Restoring Mode
```commandline
use master;
go
select name,   case recovery_model
when 1 then   'Full'
when 2 then ' Bulk_logged   '
when 3 then   'Simple' end model from sys.databases
where name not   in ('master','tempdb','model','msdb');
go
```

**Remark: The restoring mode of the database must be Full.**
- Move to step 2 if the model value is not Full.
- Move to step 3 if the model value is Full.

Users can also use the SQL Server Management Studio client tool to make a full backup of the database, and, at the same time, ensure that the database recovery mode is "Complete".

## 2. Set Restoring Mode of Database as Full.
```commandline
alter database [dbname] set recovery full;
go
```

Repeat step 1 to confirm that the database restoring mode has been successfully modified.

## 3. Backing Database
Taking a backup file named testdb.bak as an example:
```commandline
use master;
go
backup database [dbname] to disk   ='z:\Backup\testdb.bak' with compression,init,stats=5;
go
```
## 4. Verify the Integrity of Backup Files
```commandline
use master;
go
restore filelistonly 
from disk = 'z:\backup\testdb.bak';
go
```
- If a result set is returned, the backup file is valid.
- If the error prompts, the backup file is incorrect. Please back up files again.



## 5. Recover the Restoring Mode of the Database
- If the restoring mode of the database has been modified, please execute the following command to recover the restoring mode of the database;
- If no changes have been made, this step is not required.
```commandline
alter database [dbname] set recovery [model];
go
```


## 6. Create An Empty Database
Finally, create an empty database on the cloud database for importing backup files.
Users can also use the SQL Server Management Studio client tool to make a full backup of the database, and, at the same time, ensure that the database recovery mode is "Complete".
