# Create a New Instance based on Backup Data
Creating a new instance based on backup data refers to create a new instance by backing up any time point during the effective storage time. Contents can be replicated exactly same as the main instance, including instance data and instance settings. When a new instance is created based on backup data, it is recommended to select a type and storage space that is greater than or equal to the original instance, otherwise data restoration may take longer time due to performance limits.

## Precondition
