# Function Introduction
**"Performance Statistics"** can provide statistics of SQL execution performance and various statistics of indexes from various perspectives to help users identify problematic SQL and potential performance bottlenecks for targeted optimization. For example, users can find the potential problematic SQL based on the execution time, the number of executions and the return row number of SQL, analyze whether the creation and use of indexes are reasonable with respect to the table scan, least-frequently-used indexes, index size, etc., and provide missing index analysis and creation suggestions.
