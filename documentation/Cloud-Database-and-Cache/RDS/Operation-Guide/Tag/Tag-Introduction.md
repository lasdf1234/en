# Function Introduction
**"Resource Tag"** provides a method for resource classification conforming to multiple classification specifications (e.g., the Owner, purpose, etc.), allowing users to quickly locate specific resources based on tags in case of a large number of similar resources. A tag consists of a pair of key-value, both defined by users. For example, users can identify their VM resources based on the owner of VM. In addition, it is recommended to use the same batch of tags for different types of resources, such as VM and cloud databases, more convenient for users to manage resources on JD Cloud.
