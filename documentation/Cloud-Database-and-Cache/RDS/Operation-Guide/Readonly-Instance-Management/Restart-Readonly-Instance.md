2. Select the read-only instance to be rebooted, click the name of the target instance, and enter the instance detailed page.
3. Select the tag of ***Read-only Instance Management***, open the read-only instance management page, select the read-only instance to be rebooted and click ***Reboot*** in ***Operation*** column to reboot the read-only instance.
4. Popup box for the reboot confirmation is shown in the figure.
    * Click ***OK*** to reboot the read-only instance.
