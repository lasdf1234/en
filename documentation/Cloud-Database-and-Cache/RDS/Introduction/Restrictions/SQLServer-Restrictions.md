# I. Functional Limits
In order to ensure the stability and security of instances, SQL Server has some functional limits as follows:

1. Databases cannot be created or deleted through commands and accounts cannot be created, deleted or modified. Users can perform the related operations through the console if necessary.

2. Following functions are not provided:

# II. Sub-account Limits

1. SQL Server Service supports sub-accounts in most functions, and the authority of sub-accounts can be controlled by clicking [Management] --> [Identity and Access Management].

2. However, some functions do not support sub-accounts, for example:
- SQL Server instance cannot be created.
- Renewals are not supported.
- Monitoring pages cannot be viewed.
- Databases cannot be logged in through DMS.

# III. Quantitative Limit
Each account can create **Five** SQL Server instances in each region. Please submit open ticket to apply for more quotas if to create more instances.
