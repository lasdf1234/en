## Functional Limits
### Capacity Reduction Operation
* The capacity reduction of the instance currently is not supported.

### Database Version Upgrade
* Database version cannot be upgraded currently. For example, MySQL 5.6 is upgraded to MySQL 5.7.

### Instance Restore
* Deleted instances cannot be recovered.

### Instance Creation
* There are limits on the number of instances in a single region. A region can support up to 5 instances by default. If there are more instances required, please submit the open ticket.
