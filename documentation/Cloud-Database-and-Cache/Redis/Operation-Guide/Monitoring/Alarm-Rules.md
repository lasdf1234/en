# Set Alarm Rules

In the Redis console, you can set alarm rules based on monitoring items. When the monitoring item reaches the set threshold, we will send you an alarm message via SMS and email.

## Precautions

- After the Redis instance is created successfully, an alarm rule is automatically set: "Statistical Period 2 Minutes Disk Average Utilization Rate >= 75 %, Lasts 5 Cycles", you can modify it based on the actual situation.


## Action Steps

1. Log in to [Redis console](https://Redis-console.jdcloud.com/Redis).
1. On the "Instance List" page, select the target instance and click ** Instance Name** to go to the "Instance Details" page.
1. On the "Instance Details" page, click **Monitoring** to go to the "Monitoring Information" page.
1. Click ** Set Alarm Rule** on the right side of the page to enter the "Alarm Rules" page.
