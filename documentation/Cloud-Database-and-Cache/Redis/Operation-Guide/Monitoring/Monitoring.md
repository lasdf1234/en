# Performance Monitoring

Currently, there are six types of monitoring: Memory Usage, Memory Utilization Rate, Intranet Inbound and Outbound Traffic, QPS, Hit Ratio, and the Number of Instance Keys:

1. Log in to the [Redis Console](https://redis-console.jdcloud.com/redis) to locate the target instance.

2. Click Instance Name to go to the Details of the instance.

3. In the navigation tab above, select Monitoring.

4. Select Monitoring Time to view.

## Monitoring Items

- Memory Usage (MByte): Used memory of cloud cache;

- Memory Utilization Rate (%): The ratio of used memory to total memory in the cloud cache;

- Inbound and Outbound Traffic (kbps) of Intranet: Traffic flowing in and out of the cloud cache through the intranet every second;

- QPS (times/s): Number of visits per second;

- Hit Ratio (%): The probability of requesting a hit cache;

- Number of instance keys (piece): The current number of cloud cache instance keys.
