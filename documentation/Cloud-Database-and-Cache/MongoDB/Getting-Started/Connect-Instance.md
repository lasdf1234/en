# Connection Instance

For security reasons, the MongoDB currently only provides intranet connections and does not provide public network connections.

If you need to directly connect to the MongoDB instance, you can use the virtual machine proxy forwarding method. For the operation mode, please refer to [Public Network Connection MongoDB Instance](../Best-Practices/Public-Network-Connect-to-MongoDB- Instance.md).



## Precondition
- The MongoDB instance status is up and the billing status is normal.
- The MongoDB instance is in the same VPC as the virtual machine used for connection, and the connection between them is not limited by ACL, security group or white list.

## Operation Steps
1. Get the connection information for the MongoDB instance.
   1. Login [MongoDB Console](https://mongodb-console.jdcloud.com/mongodb?dataCenter=bj_02).
   1. On the "Instance List" page, select the target instance, and click the **Instance Name** to enter the "Instance Details" page.
   1. On the "Instance Details" page, view the resource information and get the connection information for the MongoDB instance.

		- Database name, default is admin.
		- User name, default is root.
		- The name of the replica set.
		- Connection address.
				
		   By default, node 1 is Primary and node 2 is Secondary. If automatic disaster tolerance occurs, the Primary and Secondary nodes may change.
                Please use Connection String URI connection for the client to ensure highly available.

2. Connection MongoDB instance.
   - Using Mongo Shell for connection

		The mongo shell is an interactive JavaScript shell that comes with MongoDB. You can use the mongo shell to query and update data or perform administrative operations.
		
		The mongo shell is part of the MongoDB distribution. You need to install MongoDB first and then connect to your MongoDB instance using the mongo shell.
		
		For the MongoDB distribution download address, please refer to: [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community).
		
		Please use the client of mongo shell 3.2 or above to connect to the MongoDB instance, otherwise the authentication may not be successful
		
		Use the mongo command to connect on the virtual machine. The command is as follows:

		> mongo --host jmongo-xxx.jmiss.jcloud.com:27017 --authenticationDatabase admin -u root -p
		
		> mongo --host jmongo-xxx.jmiss.jcloud.com:27017 --authenticationDatabase admin -u root -p
		
		or
		
		> mongo mongodb://root:****@jmongo-xxx.jmiss.jcloud.com:27017,jmongo-xxx.jmiss.jcloud.com:27017/admin?replicaSet=mgset-xxx
		
		>(****Partially replaced with root password)
		
   - Using Connection String URI to connect the instance
   
      MongoDB service can be connected in the traditional way of parameter passing. Most drivers also support connection in the form of URI. MongoDB officially recommends using URIs to connect to MongoDB services to guarantee high availability of connection. Please use the driver with MongoDB 3.2 version and higher
		
      The command style is as follows:

	   > mongodb://root:****@jmongo-xxx.jmiss.jcloud.com:27017,jmongo-xxx.jmiss.jcloud.com:27017/admin?replicaSet=mgset-xxx
	   
	   > (****Partially replaced with root password)
