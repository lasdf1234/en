### Quick Creation
MongoDB instance can be created in minutes by using the MongoDB console or a simple API call.

### Flexible Capacity Expansion
Support capacity expansion and capacity reduction. You can upgrade or downgrade instance configurations as needed according to business conditions to improve resource utilization and reduce usage costs.

## Service Availability

When the Secondary node is unavailable, the standby node takes over the service and multiple guarantee mechanisms ensure service availability.

## Single Availability Zone Deployment

Support for single availability deployment, three nodes are automatically deployed to physical machines in different racks, providing high availability across racks.

### Multiple Avialability Zone Deployment

Support for multiple availability zone deployment, you can specify the available zones for primary, secondary and hidden node deployments, and provide high availability across the machine rooms.

## Security
 
### VPC Virtual Private Cloud
The instance is deployed in a user-defined VPC virtual private cloud, and network isolation protection is performed directly at the TCP layer to ensure data security.

### White list
Support user-defined IP white list and security control from access source.
