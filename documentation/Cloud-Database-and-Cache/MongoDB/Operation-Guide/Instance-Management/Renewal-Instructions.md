# Review Instance

Via JD Cloud Console, you can renew the currently running instance. Please renew the payment within 7 days after the instance expires or owed, otherwise the instance will be deleted.

## Precautions

- For the instance with billing type pay by configuration, after the renewal is completed, the instance billing type will be changed to monthly package.

1. Enter the “Instance List” page, select the target instance, and click **Renew ** in the operation items to open the “Renewal” page.
