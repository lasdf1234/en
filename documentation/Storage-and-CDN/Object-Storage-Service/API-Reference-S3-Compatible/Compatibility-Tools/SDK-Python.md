# SDK-Python

## Overview

If you need to use Python to access Object Storage Service of JD Cloud, we can use the boto3 interface of the third party. It can be viewed as Python SDK conforming to AWS S3 API standards. About how to use boto3, please refer to https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

s3 = boto3.client(  
    's3',  
    aws_access_key_id=ACCESS_KEY,  
    aws_secret_access_key=SECRET_KEY,  
    #下面给出一个endpoint_url的例子
