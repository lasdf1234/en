## Callback

After completion of compress object generation task, if the user sets the callback address for task completion in the request (namely, x-amz-notification-endpoint parameter in the above text), OSS will notify the user requests of task processing through the callback interface provided by the callback user through the POST method.

Callback interface

|Header|Description|
|-|-|
|x-amz-sns-message-type|must be Notification|
|x-amz-sns-raw-key|must be true|
|RequestID|RequestID|

                    "key": "object-key",
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
**Callback assurance**

Each request, whether successful or unsuccessful, is called back, and will be called back at the first time when Object is generated and completed

The callback retries when the server is temporarily unavailable; the interval time between retries will be gradually increased, if the retry will not be successful in one day, such callback will be aborted

The order of the callbacks is not guaranteed, it is not related with the time initiating Compress request and the time of successful generation of CompressObject.

** Callback security**

In phase I, the OSS callback mechanism does not include a validation mechanism; a malicious user may forge an OSS callback request to call back your callback service, it is suggested that you can add necessary validation information to the dynamically generated callback address to avoid from being maliciously call-backed.
