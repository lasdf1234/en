# Use S3fs to mount Bucket on the Linux instance

S3fs is a FUSE-based file system, which allows Linux to mount Bucket to the local file system and S3fs can remain the original format of the object. By using S3fs, a Bucket can be mounted into the Linux system as a folder and used as a system folder.

## Refer to the official description for environment installation and configuration

https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse

System with centos7 and above revision

**1. Installation dependent package**
```
sudo yum install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make openssl-devel
```
**2. Installation and compilation**
```
git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git
cd s3fs-fuse
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
**3. Create password file**
```
echo key:sercert > /home/passwd-s3fs
chmod 600 /home/passwd-s3fs
```
Description

key: secret obtaining method: https://uc.jdcloud.com/account/accessKey

chmod 600: Only the current user can access the key file setting.

**4. Mount object storage service to local catalog/new**
```
mkdir /new
s3fs bucketname /new -o passwd_file=/home/passwd-s3fs -o url="http://s3.cn-north-1.jcloudcs.com"
```
Description

mkdir: Create a new folder as the local mounting catalog.

s3fs: Manually mount commands, in which the bucketname is the bucket name, /new is the local mounting path, passwd_file is the password file location, and url is the S3 domain name compatible to JD Cloud object storage service (please input service domain name where the bucket is located)

**5. View mounting results**
```
df -h
```

**6. Log in the catalog to view the object file**

**Tips：**

When mounting JD Cloud object storage service with the s3fs-fuse tool and copying files with cp commands, the following solutions can be taken when the file mime-type is modified:

1. Use the cp command to copy files; the actions carried by the s3fs-fuse tool on the bottom are dependent on the file /etc/mime.types and the file determines the mime-type attribute of the cp command target file.

2. By default, the centos7 revision of JD Cloud does not contain the /etc/mime.types file. Thus, it needs to obtain such file by copying or installing httpd and the installation command is yum install httpd.

3. For catalogs mounted by the s3fs command, it needs to be unmounted at first and the command will take effect once the s3fs command is executed once again.
