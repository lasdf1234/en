Standard Storage: standard storage provides users with high-reliability, high-availability and high-performance object storage service. Standard storage has low access delay and higher throughput, so it is applicable to the business scenario where has large throughput and hotspot files required frequently access, e.g. mobile application, large-scale websites, picture sharing, hotspot audio/video, etc.
