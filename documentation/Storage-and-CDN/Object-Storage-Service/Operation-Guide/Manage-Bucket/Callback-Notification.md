# Callback notification

OSS supports the callback notification function. You can make the callback notification in time while specifying relevant operation of some resources. The OSS event notification is carried out asynchronously, causing no influence to the OSS operation. The callback notification is often seen in the following application scenarios, for example:
* New data are uploaded to OSS from picture sharing platforms and audio and video platforms.
* Relevant contents in OSS are updated.
* Important files in OSS are deleted.

OSS callback notification comprises the two parts, including the **configuration callback notification** and the **message notification**.
* Configuration callback notification: When configuring the callback rules in a Bucket, it needs to specify related resources, relevant events and callback URL for initiating the notice. The configuration is only valid for this Bucket.
* Message notification: When the event notification is triggered in the Bucket, the notification content in specified format will be sent to the callback URL. The notification method is HTTP(S).

Callback notification process:<br>
1. Specify a Bucket to set the message notification rules.

2. When the message notification rule is triggered by the event, the message notification will be sent to the callback URL.

3. The callback server accepts the message notification and return 200.

4. If the callback server gives no response, OSS will retry for three times. If there is still no response, it is believed that the callback is failed.

## Configuration callback notification

You can specify a Bucket to enable the callback notification. Once being enabled, OSS will send the message notification as per rules of NotificationConfiguration.

### Configuration method
You can specify a Bucket to create or change the NotificationConfiguration via PUT Bucket notification. NotificationConfiguration is in the XML format:

```
    <NotificationConfiguration>
        <TopicConfiguration>
            <Id>ConfigurationId</Id>  
            <Filter>
                <S3Key>
                    <FilterRule>
                        <Name>prefix</Name>
                        <Value>prefix-value</Value>
                    </FilterRule>
                    <FilterRule>
                        <Name>suffix</Name>
                        <Value>suffix-value</Value>
                    </FilterRule>
               </S3Key>
            </Filter>
            <Topic>NS:endpoint1,endpoint2</Topic>
            <Event>event-type</Event>
            <Event>event-type</Event>
            ...
        </TopicConfiguration>
        ...
    </NotificationConfiguration>
```
Note:
* TopicConfiguration: Relevant configuration rules for message notification, supporting many rules When the event is triggered, TopicConfiguration will be matched one by one in orders via the Object and the event type. If the match is successful, the message notification will be sent and the match is terminated.
* Id: the unique identifier of TopicConfiguration; if it is not set, OSS will assign an ID randomly
* Topic: When the time of occurrence is specified, OSS will send message to this topic in the format of NS:endpoint1,endpoint2,endpoint3 (it must begin with "NS:", several addresses must be separated with ",” and at most 5 addresses are configured)
* Event: Event type triggering notification
* Filter: Resource filtering rule. If no, all resources under the Bucket shall come into force
* S3Key: Defining resource filtering rules
* FilterRule: Defining filtering rules and standard key-value pair
* Name: prefix or suffix, screening one or more objects based on object key name
* Value: Specifying the prefix or suffix of object key name to be selected

### Support event type
Event type|Description
---|---
s3:ObjectCreated:* |Create Object behavior, including Put Object, Post Object, Copy Object and Complete Multipart Upload
s3:ObjectCreated:Put |Use Put Object to upload files
s3:ObjectCreated:Post |Use Post Object to upload files
s3:ObjectCreated:Copy |Use Put Object-Copy to copy files
s3:ObjectCreated:CompleteMultipartUpload |Complete multipart upload
s3:ObjectRemoved:* |Delete Object behaviors, including Delete Object
s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete |Delete file

### Customized Parameter

OSS supports carrying customized parameters in the request URL. You can bring `x-oss-callback-var=[CallBackVar]` as a url parameter to the request and send it.

The customized parameter begins with "x-oss-callback-". After receiving the request, OSS checks if there is a parameter starting with "x-oss-callback-", and if so, it will be added to the message notification content.
For example, if "x-oss-callback-a=test1" and "x-oss-callback-b=test2" are specified in the request URL, the following content will be added to the message notification:
```
"callBackVar": {
    "callBackVars": {                 
	"a":["test1"],
	"b":["test2"]
    }
}
```

## Message Notification
When the callback notification is triggered, OSS will generate a message notification to the callback URL. The event message is in JSON format and has the following structure:
```
{  
   "Records":[  
      {  
         "eventVersion":"1.0",  //版本号，目前为"1.0"
         "eventSource":"oss",  //事件源，固定为"oss"
         "awsRegion":"cn-north-1",  //Bucket所在region
         "eventTime":Mon, 06 Aug 2018 10:19:51 GMT,  //事件触发时间
         "eventName":"event-type",  //事件类型
         "userIdentity":{  
            "principalId":"userId-of-the-user-who-caused-the-event"  //触发事件用户ID
         },
         "requestParameters":{  
            "sourceIPAddress":"domain-name-where-request-came-from"  //发起事件请求的域名
         },
         "responseElements":{  
            "x-amz-request-id":"OSS generated request ID"  //发起事件的请求ID
         },
         "s3":{  
            "s3SchemaVersion":"1.0",  //通知内容版本号，目前为"1.0"
            "configurationId":"ID found in the bucket notification configuration",  //事件通知配置中ConfigurationId
            "bucket":{  
               "name":"bucket-name",  //Bucket名称
               "ownerIdentity":{  
                  "principalId":"userId-of-the-bucket-owner"  //Bucket owner用户ID
               }
            },
            "object":{  
               "key":"object-key",  //Object名称
               "eTag":"object eTag"  //Object的etag，与GetObject请求返回的ETag头的内容相同
            }
         },
	"callBackVar": {  //回调通知配置中的自定义参数
	    "callBackVars": {                 
		"var1":["value1","value3"],
		"var2":["value2"]
	    }
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

## Callback Server

### Verify the Callback URL
When configuring the callback notification request, OSS sends a verification message to the callback URL to verify whether it is available. The callback server needs to resolve and return as required. If there is no response, the configuration callback notification fails and returns 400. 

Verification Process:

1. OSS sends a request to the callback server with an x-jdcloud-message-type header with a value of "SubscriptionConfiguration" or "Notification". If it is "SubscriptionConfiguration", the request is identified as a subscription confirmation request; if it is "Notification", the request is identified as a message notification request.

2. The callback server needs to verify whether the x-jdcloud-message-type header is "SubscriptionConfiguration". If so, it returns the message encoded by using base64 to confirm the subscription.

You can configure the callback server according to the following examples:
```
//简单格式的消息通知
    @RequestMapping("/notifications1")
    public String notifications1(@RequestBody String message
            , @RequestHeader HttpHeaders headers) {
		
        if (headers.get("x-jdcloud-message-type").get(0).equals("SubscriptionConfirmation")) {
			//设置时对url的校验，需要对message进行base64编码并返回
            return Base64Utils.encodeToString(message.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        } else {
            //消息通知处理  your code，处理完毕后需要返回 http code 200，body不做校验
            return "";
        }
    }
```
### Callback Signature
If your callback server is maliciously attacked by others, as the malicious callback of your application server, the application server receives some illegal requests and the normal logic is affected. In such case, you need to judge if the callback request is from OSS. Please refer to the document: [Callback Signature Verification]() for the verification of callback signature.
