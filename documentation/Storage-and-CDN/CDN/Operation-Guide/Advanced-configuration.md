**range Back-to-source**

The range back-to-source means that the content of the request sent by the client to the origin server is a part of the byte range carrying requested content. The range back-to-source can reduce the back-to-source traffic consumption and improve the resource response time.

After being turned on, the origin server is required to support the range request.
