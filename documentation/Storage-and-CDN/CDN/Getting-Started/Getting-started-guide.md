  ​            4. The domain name of which the compliance has been approved will be displayed as “stopped” status. Please complete the CNAME binding before enabling the service.

  **Step 4: Bind CNAME**

  1. Enter the 【domain name list】 page in the CDN customer console, and replicate the CNAME of the approved domain name;

  2. Log in to the domain name DNS service provider console to complete the CNAME configuration.

  Take your JD Cloud resolution domain name as an example, the CNAME binding method is as follows:

  1) Log in to [JD Cloud Console](https://www.jdcloud.com/index) and enter the [【Domain Name Service--JD Cloud Resolution】](https://dns-console.jdcloud.com/list) page, click the domain name to be bound

  2) Select the domain name to be bound, click “Resolution”, enter the domain name resolution interface, click “Add Resolution”, select the record type as “CNAME”, and fill in the CNAME information allocated by JD Cloud customer console for the domain name in the record value.

  3. Modifying the DNS server requires 0-72 hours of global effective time; if you find that some local records have not taken effect, and the time since modifying DNS is less than 72 hours, please be patient and wait.

  **Step 5: Enable CDN Service**

  ​           After completing the CNAME binding, you can click on "Run" following the domain name to start the CDN service.

  ²  After starting the action, the service will take effect in 15 minutes.

  ²  When performing the switching action, it is recommended to switch the small traffic domain name first, then switch the large traffic domain name; operate cautiously to avoid human error.

  ²  For the large file download acceleration business, it is recommended to prewarm the files under the domain name before starting the service, so as to ensure the user experience of the netizens in the initial stage of the CDN service switched to the JD Cloud CDN.
