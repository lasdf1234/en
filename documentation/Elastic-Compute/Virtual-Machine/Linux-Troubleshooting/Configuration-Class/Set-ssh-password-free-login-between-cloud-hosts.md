# Set ssh Automatic Login Between Virtual Machines

The ssh automatic login needs to use public key and private key. Under Linux, use ssh-keygen to generate public/private key pairs, taking CentOS as an example.

There are virtual machine A(192.168.1.155) and virtual machine B(192.168.1.181). And set the user of virtual machine A to the  user of virtual machine B through ssh automatic login.

If the root user sets the automatic login, replace the path /home/user in the following method with /root. When using scp to replicate, replace the target machine user with root.

1. Generate public/private key pairs under virtual machine A.

*[user@A ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa*

When an interactive interface appears and it is required to enter password and key pair save path, etc., press Enter to generate by default.
After the execution is successful, the .ssh directory is generated under /home/user. There are id_rsa and id_rsa.pub under .ssh.

2. Copy id_rsa.pub under virtual machine A machine to the same path under virtual machine B. When using the scp command, you will be asked to enter the user's login password of virtual machine B. Enter the password and press Enter to complete the copy

*[user@A ~]$ scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub user@192.168.1.181:/home/user/id_rsa.pub* 

*user@192.168.1.181's password:'s password:*

*id_rsa.pub                                    100%  223     0.2KB/s   00:00*


3. Virtual machine B adds id_rsa.pub copied from virtual machine A to /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

*[user@B ~]$ cat /home/user/id_rsa.pub >> /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys*

*[user@B ~]$ chmod 600 /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys*


Authority of authorized_keys is to be set to 600.

4. Virtual machine A logs in to virtual machine B.

*[user@A ~]$ ssh user@192.168.1.181*

*The authenticity of host 'B (192.168.1.181)' can't be established.*

*RSA key fingerprint is 00:a6:a8:87:eb:c7:40:10:39:cc:a0:eb:50:d9:6a:5b.*

*Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes*

*Warning: Permanently added  '192.168.1.181' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.*

*Last login: Thu Mar 3 09:53:18 2018 from user*

*[user@B ~]$*



The first time you log in, you need to enter yes to add virtual machine B to the known machine list of virtual machine A

Now, the user of virtual machine A can automatically log in to the user of virtual machine B.

To realize mutual automatic login of virtual machine A and B, configure on virtual machine B by the above method and add id_rsa.pub content generated by virtual machine B to authorized_keys file of virtual machine A.
