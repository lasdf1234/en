**Problem Phenomenon:**

When the Linux virtual machine views the log by tail, it prompts insufficient space. The error message is as follows:

**Problem Causes:**

The tail operation requires system monitoring quota. The number of watch added by the same user exceeds max_user_watches parameter configuration of the kernel, leading to the problem.



**Solution:**

Modify /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches to a larger value:

*sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=8192* # Take 8192 as an example, this mode takes effect temporarily

To take effect permanently, you need to modify /etc/sysctl.conf, add max_user_watches=8192, and then take effect by the following command:

*sysctl -p*
