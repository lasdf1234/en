**Solution:**

Log in to the virtual machine, edit the ssh configuration file, and enter the command:


*vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config*

The parameter ClientAliveInterval is the duration of SSH connection, the value is second, you can set it yourself.

E.g.:


*ClientAliveInterval 300*, which indicates 300 seconds, that is, 5 minutes.


In addition, ClientAliveCountMax is the number of times of SSH's allowable timeout. If the customer's does not respond, it will be judged as a timeout.
