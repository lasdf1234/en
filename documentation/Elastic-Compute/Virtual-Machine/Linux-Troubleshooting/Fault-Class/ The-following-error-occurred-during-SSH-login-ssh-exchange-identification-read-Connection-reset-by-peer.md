3. If you need to modify the relevant policy configuration, it is recommended to perform a file backup before proceeding.

4. Use an editor such as vi to modify the relevant configuration in /etc/hosts.allow  and /etc/hosts.deny as needed, or the entirely delete or comment (add # at the beginning) the entire line configuration. For example:


*# all:all:deny*
