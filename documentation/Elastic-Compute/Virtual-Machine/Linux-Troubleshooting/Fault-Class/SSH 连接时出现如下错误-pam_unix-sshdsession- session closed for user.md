# Following Error Ocurrs at SSH Login: pam_unix(sshdsession) session closed for user



Note: The configuration and instructions of Linux in this article have been tested on the CentOS 6.5 64-bit operating system. For other types and versions of the operating system, configuration may vary. Please refer to the official documentation for the details about relevant operating systems.



**Problem Description:**

When logging in to a Linux virtual machine using SSH, even if the password is entered correctly, an error message as follows will appear in the command line or secure log, causing the connection to fail:

*This account is currently not available.*

*Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.*

*Received disconnect from 127.0.0.1: 11: disconnected by user.*

*pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user test.*



**Problem Causes:**

This problem is usually caused by the corresponding user's default Shell being modified.



Solution:

1. Enter the system via console vnc.

2. View the default Shell of the corresponding user by the following command:


*cat /etc/passwd | grep test*

*test: x :1000:1000::/home/test:/sbin/nologin*

Check if the corresponding user's Shell has been modified to nologin.



3. If you need to modify the relevant policy configuration, it is recommended to perform a file backup before proceeding.

4. Use an editor such as vi to change the default Shell of the corresponding user to bash, eg.:


*vi /etc/passwd*

Modify /sbin/nologin to /bin/bash

5. Try connecting to the server again from the client.
