# Windows System

SC Command
The SC command is a Windows native service control command, by which, standard Windows services can be easily added and deleted:

# Add Service

*sc create ServiceName binpath= "D:\services\xxx.exe"*

# Remove Service

*sc delete ServiceName*

Attention:

● A space shall be reserved after binpath parameters.

● Users shall configure it manually after services are added, such as, setting the startup type as "Automatic".

● Users can view and manage registered services via services.msc.
