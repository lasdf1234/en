4. Because it is not a domain control environment, you can simply choose "Independent (A)".

9. Set the valid period of the certificate, which by default is 5 years. This can be set according to the situation of the Web.

3. It should be noted that the computer name or domain name cannot be changed after the certificate is installed.

3. Set a name that is concise and understandable.

2. Set the main directory of the website, set the type as https, and simply select the testca that is set in the previous stage for SSL certificate.

3. Set an Index.html test page in the root directory of the website.

4. Select the site and click the default document.

5. Move the Index.html default document to the top.

6. Perform access test with HTTPS used for the external network. You can see it and access it, but because the certificate is not issued by a public CA, there will be a security tip. If you purchased a CA certificate, when a paid certificate is used, usually there will be no such security risk tip.

7. Select "Move on" and you will find that the website can be accessed normally.
