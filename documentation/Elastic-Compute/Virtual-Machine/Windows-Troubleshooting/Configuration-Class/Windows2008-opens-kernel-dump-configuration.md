# Enable Kernel Dump in Windows2008
Windows does not have Core Dump enabled by default. In some special cases, such as blue screen, stuck, hang, black screen, etc., Core Dump needs to be used to locate the root cause of the problem more quickly for targeted processing.



There are 2 ways to configure it, as mentioned in the official Microsoft KB:

We recommend that you use the manual configuration tool, and to prevent system startup failure and possible data loss caused by configuration problems, please make sure to create an image of the system disk and make a snapshot and backup of the data disk before performing the configuration.

5. Select the custom size of paging files of all drives, which is recommended to set as "System Memory Size +1 MB", or the file size under the system management to achieve the optimized system allocation of paging files. Meanwhile, make sure that the system disk has enough free space to store paging files and the follow-up Dump files.
