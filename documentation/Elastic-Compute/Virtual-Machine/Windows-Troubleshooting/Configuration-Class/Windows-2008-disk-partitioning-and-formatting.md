# Windows2008 Disk Partition and Formatting
Note: Disk partitioning and formatting are high-risk behaviors, please operate with caution. The following operations are for newly purchased data disks. If it involves the processing of the original data disk, make sure to create a snapshot for the data disk of the virtual machine to avoid possible data loss.



**The data disk just purchased, by default, is not partitioned and formatted. You can refer to the following methods to initially configure it:**

1. Click Server Manager in the lower left corner.
