# Windows High Bandwidth Occupation Processing
**Possible Reasons for High Bandwidth Occupation of the Server: **

1. The frequent access of the user to the service causes large bandwidth occupation.

2. Network traffic is caused by malicious viruses and Trojans. Sometimes three-party malicious programs may disguise in svchost.exe or Tcpsvcs.exe of the operating system, causing high bandwidth occupation.

3. Windows services (update service, etc.) may occupy higher network traffic.

**View the occupation by the process of bandwidth through Windows Resource Monitor:**

Open the [Task Manager]->[Performance]->[Resource Monitor]->[Network] in Windows 2008 R2, as shown below:

Open [Task Manager]->[Performance]->[Resource Monitor]->[Network] in Windows 2012 R2, as shown below:

If the process is a normal service process and high client traffic results in high bandwidth usage, please consider to purchase more bandwidth as appropriate.

If the process is a name suspicious process, please stop the process directly, or use professional anti-virus software to observe the server behavior after virus killing.

If your problem still can not solved, please submit open ticket to us.
