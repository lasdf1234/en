**Problem Causes:**

It is because that Windows update service is not running.



**Solution:**

Click [Start] and execute services.msc, and press [Enter] to find the windows update service. The status is disabled by default, and change it as [Manual] and enable it. Install the .net3.5 component online, and disable the windows update service as per demand after the installation is complete.
