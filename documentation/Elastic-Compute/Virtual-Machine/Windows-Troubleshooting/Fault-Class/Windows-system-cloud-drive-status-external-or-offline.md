Note: If [Online] is selected, it will prompt as follows:

The disk is offline since it has a signature collision with another online disk.

The problem indicates that Windows has an exception during the auto attach process. Take the disk offline then online. Windows attempts to regenerate the signature of the disk during the online process.
