**Problem Causes:**

On May 8, 2018, Microsoft released an updated patch that changed the default settings of Windows from "vulnerable" to "alleviated". This updating patch requires that both the server and client are updated to achieve the remote connection. When the VM does not update the patch, but the user client did, the server may be unable to be connected remotely.



**Solution:**

1. Users input *gpedit.msc* in the [Running] and enter [Local Group Policy Editor] on the client.

This issue also applies to the case where the password is re-entered (entering the password twice) after the remote logging to the VM: change the status of the Encryption Oracle Remediation from unconfigured to enabled, and set the protection level as vulnerable.
