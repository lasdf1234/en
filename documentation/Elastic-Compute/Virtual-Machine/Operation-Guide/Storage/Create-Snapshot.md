# Create Cloud Disk Snapshot

A snapshot can retain the state of data in the cloud disk at a certain time point as a data backup.

* To ensure data integrity, please stop writing to the cloud disk before creating a snapshot to ensure the integrity of snapshot data;
* It is recommended that you uninstall the cloud disk before making a snapshot, re-attach the disk to the instance after creating a snapshot. Please refer to [Detach Cloud Disk](Detach-Cloud-Disk.md), [Attach Cloud Disk](Attach) -Cloud-Disk.md);
