# Storage Type

## System Disk

The system disk supports local disk and cloud disk.

For local disk, you can't select the capacity and a capacity of 40GB is given as a present; it is created along with the virtual machine and its life cycle is the same as that of the instance, that is, it starts or ends with the instance life cycle.

For the cloud disk, SSD cloud disk and premium Hdd cloud disk are available and the capacity can be specified within the range of 40GB~500GB. A non-multi-point attaching cloud disk that is billed by configuration can be set to be deleted on instance termination. If it is set to be deleted on instance termination, the disk will be deleted when the instance is deleted. The attribute of the disk under monthly package or multi-point attached disk does not take effect, and the disk will remain when the instance is deleted.

## Data Disk

The data disk provides two storage options, SSD cloud disk and premium Hdd cloud disk, to satisfy business scenarios with different performance requirements.

### SSD Cloud Disk
The SSD cloud disk utilizes a distributed multi-copy mechanism to provide stable high-performance storage with high random I/O and high data reliability. The specific indicators are as follows:

* Single Disk Capacity: 20-1000G
* Maximum IOPS of A Single Disk: 20000
* Maximum Throughput of A Single Disk: 100MBps
* Data Reliability: 99.9999999%

SSD cloud disk, with stable high random I/O performance and high data reliability, is applicable to the following scenarios:
	
* Big data analysis, I/O intensive business, medium and large database applications
* Medium and large development and test environment with high requirements for data reliability.

### Premium Hdd Cloud Disk
The premium Hdd cloud disk uses a mechanical disk as a storage medium and has the following features:

* Single Disk Capacity: 20-3000G
* Maximum IOPS of A Single Disk: 3000
* Maximum Throughput of A Single Disk: 80MBps
* Data Reliability: 99.9999999%

Typical Application Scenarios:

* Small and medium databases, large development tests, web servers
* Medium and large development and test applications with high requirements for data reliability and medium performance requirements
