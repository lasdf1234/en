# Share Private Image
A shared image is a private image that you share your private images created with other JD Cloud users. You can easily get permission to use the image from other users, get the necessary components and can add custom content, or you can share your private images created through the "Image Sharing" function with other JD Cloud accounts.
Only the owner of the image has permission to share the image, and the shared image cannot be shared again by the user shared to other JD Cloud users.
It is important to note that JD Cloud cannot guarantee the integrity and security of the images that other users share with you, and we recommend that you only use shared images from trusted sources.
