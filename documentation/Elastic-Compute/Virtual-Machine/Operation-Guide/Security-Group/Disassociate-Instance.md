6. Click [OK] in the confirmation pop-up window.

		Please note:
		* If the current security group is the only security group bound to the main network interface of current instance, the current security group cannot be deleted until the other security group is bound to the instance.
		* The instance side only supports the security group unbinding operation on the main network interface of current instance. To perform the instance auxiliary network interface operation, operate from the security group side.



In addition, you can also unbind from the security group console. Refer to [Security Group Unbinding Instance](../../../../Networking/Virtual-Private-Cloud/Operation-Guide/Security-Group-Configuration.md) for details.
