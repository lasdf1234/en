# Enable CC Protection
After an instance is associated to an EIP, you can enable CC protection and configure the threshold for automatic cleaning of CC attacks. When the number of https requests per second or the number of new connections per second is exceeded, automatic cleaning protection is enabled. Please go to the details page of virtual machine. If EIP is associated, the CC protection switch button will appear. Please configure the parameters according to your actual situation.
