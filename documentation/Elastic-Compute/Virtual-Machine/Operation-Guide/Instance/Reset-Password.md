# Reset Password

If you choose to set password later when creating instance, you can reset the login password of instance periodically by resetting password on the console in case you lose your password or consider business and data security.

## Precondition

The instance must be in the "Running" status. If the instance is in the "Stopped" status, please operate [Start Instance](Start-Instance.md) first; if the instance is in other unstable status, please wait for the pre-order operation to complete before resetting password.
	
	Please note that: After the reset password operation is complete, you need to reboot virtual machine on the console to make the new password take effect. Rebooting will interrupt your business, so it is recommended that you plan your operating time to reduce the impact of your operations.

## Operation Steps
1. Access [Virtual Machine Console](https://cns-console.jdcloud.com/host/compute/list) and enter the instance list page. Or access [JD Cloud Console](https://console.jdcloud.com) Click navigation bar on the left [Elastic Compute] - [Virtual Machine] to enter the instance list page.
2. Select Regions.
3. In the Instance list, select the instance that the password needs resetting and confirm that its status is "Running". If you need to operate multiple instances at the same time, you can complete through multiple selection.
4. Single Operation: Click [Operate] - [More] - [Reset Password], or click instance name to enter the details page and click [Operate] - [Reset Password]
<br>Batch operation: Click [More] - [Reset Password] below the list
