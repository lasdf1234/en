# Instance Life Cycle

The instance life cycle refers to the cycle from the start of creation (purchase) to the final release (the expiration of the monthly package instance, the arrears of the billing paid by configuration instance, or the active deletion of the payment by configuration instance user). The following table shows the possible status of an instance during the life cycle instance.

Error|Stable Status|The status of the instance after the exception occurred in the operation instance is defined as the "error" status. The system will automatically roll back the "Error" instance caused by the instance exception. (The instance will not be queried after a period of time. There is no charge for the instance: if the billing is paid by configuration, there will be no relevant bill for the next deduction period; if it is the monthly package billing, advance receipts will be returned to the original payment method), and the user does not need to delete it by himself; for other "Error" instances caused by exception operation, the user can delete automatically or contact customer service support through ticket.
