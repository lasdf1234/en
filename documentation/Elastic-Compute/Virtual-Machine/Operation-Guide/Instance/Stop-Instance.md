# Stop Instance

If you need to suspend the instance service or as a precondition for other operations, such as rebuild, etc., you can stop the instance.

## Precondition

The instance must be in the "Running" status. If the instance is in the "Stopped" status, the instance has been stopped and no secondary operation is necessary. If the instance is in other unstable status, please wait for the pre-order operation to complete before stopping.
	
	Please note:
	* Stopping the operation will cause your business to be interrupted, please be cautious;
	* After the trigger of stop operation, the instance will enter the "Stopping" status and the instance will not be able to perform other operations. When the stop is complete, the instance will enter the "Stopped" status.
