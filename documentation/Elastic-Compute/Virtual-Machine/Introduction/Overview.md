Management of virtual machine is simpler and more efficient than that of the physical servers, and you can flexibly combine these resources according to actual needs. Besides, you can create a specified number of virtual machines at any time through the console, OpenAPI or CLI. During using, it is available to adjust the instance types based on the business scale as well as to release the excess or idle resources to save on input costs. JD Cloud virtual machine provides you with a stable and reliable foundation to realize rapid deployment of applications and enable you to focus on core business innovation.
