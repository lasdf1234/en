# Application Scenario

**Microservice Architecture**

According to analyze and carry on business modeling for certain business field, microservice separates complicated business logic into a group of services which are small and concentrated, with low degree of coupling and highly autonomic; the light-weighted and unified deployment characteristics of native container bring about brand new ideas to realize the unified management, scheduling and deployment for each microservice and greatly reduced the independent relation between services and between versions, so that the same microservice keeps good uniformity in different environments.

 

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment**

The DevOps platform which is based on native container provides basic development environment for users, so that developers can only focus on code developing and reduce the installation and configuration workload for relevant tools. At the same time, abundant container images enable operation and maintenance staffs fast deploying service needed for development in the platform and it supports associate service according to environment variables. Realize isolation among developing environment, testing environment and producing environment and the fast building and recycling.

 

**Fast auto scaling**

With the help of the capacity of the container which can fast start, fast deploy and is mass concurrent, as for applications which have rapidly changed demands and require to fast start hundreds of or even thousands of machines, the container can well meet the emergency business demands. This scheme shall combine with auto scaling, which will support auto scaling later, and can be expected.
