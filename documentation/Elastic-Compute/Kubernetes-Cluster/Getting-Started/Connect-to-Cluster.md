The Kubernetes command-line client kubectl may allow you to connect from the client computer to the Kubernetes cluster for application deployment.

 2. Install and set up kubectl client. For more information, see Installing and setting kubectl;
 3. Configure cluster credentials: Credentials are configured in the Kubernetes Service-cluster service-cluster-detail page-kubectl client and copied to $HOME/.kube/config; once it is configured, you can use kubectl to access Kubernetes Services from local computers.
