# Core Concept

| Concept    |    Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Cluster |it refers to the collection of JD Cloud resources required for container operation, including cloud servers, cloud disk services, EIP and load balancer |
| Work node |An VM instance that has been installed with Kubernetes components such as Docker Engine, Kubelet, and network plug-ins must be first registered on a cluster before it can be used to deploy and manage containers when the status is available.     |
|Working node group | A set of working nodes with the same configuration.   |
|Container | A runtime instance created by Docker image. A working node can run multiple containers.    |
| Image | Docker image is a special file system, which contains not only the files needed by the container such as programs, libraries, resources, and configuration, but also some configuration parameters (such as anonymous volume, environment variables, users, etc.) for runtime. Deployment of containerized applications requires specifying images, which are identified by the image ID and uniquely identified by the image repository URI and the image Tag.    |
| Service | A set of micro-services composed of containers defined by the same image and configuration, and rules for accessing these containers.   |


Kubernetes related concepts
Kubernetes is a large-scale container scheduling system for automatic deployment, expansion and management of container applications. Features such as portability, scalability, and automatic scheduling.

|   Concept  | Explanation     |
| --- | --- |
| Node    |  The computing power in the Kubernetes Service is provided by Node, which is the worker machine of all Pod running in the Kubernetes Service, either physical or virtual. The unified feature of the work machine is to run the container running on the kubelet management node.   |
| Namespace     |  Namespaces provide virtual isolation for Kubernetes Services. The Kubernetes Service initially has three namespaces, the default namespace, the system namespace kube-system, and kube-public. In addition, administrators can create new namespaces to meet the needs.   |
|  Pod   |   	Pod is the smallest basic unit for Kubernetes to deploy applications or services. A Pod encapsulates multiple application containers (or a single container), storage resources, a separate network IP, and policy options to manage and control how the container runs.  |
| Replication Controller, RC |  RC ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any time in the Kubernetes Service. By monitoring the Pod in running, the specified number of Pod replicas can be guaranteed to run in the cluster. The specified quantity can be 1 or more than 1; if it is less than the specified quantity, RC will start to run the new Pod replica; if it is more than the specified quantity, RC will terminate the excess Pod replica.   |
| Replica Set (Replica Set, RS)	    | ReplicaSet (RS) is an upgrade version of RC. The only difference is the support for the selector. RS can support a wider variety of matching modes. Objects of replica set are generally not used separately, but it used as the ideal state parameter of Deployment.    |
| Deployment | Deployment represents one update operation for Kubernetes Service by the users. The application of deployment is broader than that of RS. It can create a new service, update a new service or rolling upgrade a service. Rolling upgrading a service is a composite operation, which creates a new RS in fact, then gradually increases the quantity of replica in new RS to the ideal state and reduces the quantity of replica in the old RS to 0. It is hard to use one RS to describe this composite operation, therefore it can use Deployment, which is more universal, to describe it. It is not recommended to manually manage the RS created by Deployment.  |
|  Service   | Service is also the basic operation unit of Kubernetes. It is the abstraction of real application services. Behind each service, there is numerous corresponding containers to provide support. Container delivered from service request to the back end shall be decided by the port of Kube-Proxy port and service selector. This process manifests itself as one single access interface. The external part does not need to know how the backend runs, which brings great benefits to the extension or maintenance of the backend.    |
| labels	 | The substance of Labels is a series of Key/Value pairs attached on resource objects. It is used for specifying attributes of objects which are meaningful to the user. Labels have no direct significance to the kernel system. Labels can be assigned directly when creating an object, or they can be modified at any later time. Each object can have multiple labels, but the key value must be unique.   |
| Volume    |  	Volume in Kubernetes Service is somewhat similar to Docker's volume, except that action range of Docker's volume is a container, and lifecycle and action range of Kubernetes' volume is a Pod. Volume declared in each Pod shall be shared by all containers in the Pod. Support the use of logical storage Persistent Volume Claim (PVC). Users can ignore the actual storage technology in background. Specific configuration of Persistent Volume(pv) shall be configured by the storage administrator.   |
|Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)     | PV and PVC make the Kubernetes Service to have the logical abstraction capabilities of storage and make it possible to ignore the configuration of the actual back-end’s storage technology in the logic that configures the Pod, and this configuration work can be handed over to the configurator of the PV. This relationship between PV and PVC regarding storage is very similar to the relationship between Node and Pod regarding calculation; PV and Node are the providers of resources and will vary according to the change of cluster’s infrastructure. They are configured by the administrator of Kubernetes Service; While PVC and Pod are the users of resources and they will vary according to the change of requirements for business services. They are configured by the users of the Kubernetes Service which are the administrator of the service.   |
|   Ingress	  | Rule collection which authorizes inbound connections to reach the cluster services. You can provide externally accessible URL, load balancer, SSL and name-based virtual machine, etc. through the configuration of Ingress. Users shall request ingress through this manner - POST Ingress resource to the API server. Ingress controller is responsible for realizing the Ingress. It usually uses the load balancer. It can also configure border route and other front ends, which contributes to handle the traffic in the manner of HA.   |
