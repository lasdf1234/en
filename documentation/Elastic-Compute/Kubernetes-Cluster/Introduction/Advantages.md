# Features

| | JD Cloud Kubernetes Service | Self -built Kubernetes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of use | Create Kubernetes Service on the console at one button; the management node adopts a fully trusteeship mode, which eliminates the tedious deployment, operation and maintenance and upgrading; the work node customized image is provided, and various components needed for cluster work nodes are preset.   | Various components, configuration files, certificates and related plug-ins required for Kubernetes Service need to be manually configured with high complexity and long deployment time. |
| Reliability | In the same region, the management and work nodes of the cluster can be deployed across the availability zone, supporting a single cluster to run at least three Virtual Machines as a management node. At the same time, based on JD Cloud availability group isolation fault domain, the reliability can be further enhanced.  | Self-built availability Kubernetes Service needs to consider management, configuration management of working nodes, and solutions for redundant backup, with complex configuration process and difficult maintenance.   |
| Function | Based on JD Cloud SDN network, CNI network plug-in is provided, relying on the availability and reliability of JD Cloud VPC, which can easily adapt to the network needs of different scale production environment; provide CRI storage plug-in, integrate JD Cloud disk and provide safe and reliable persistent storage; integrate JD Cloud load balancer service and provide secure and reliable network access.  |Solve the Kubernetes Service network problems based on open source projects, with cumbersome operation and maintenance work; Unable to use the storage resources provided on the cloud, the data persistence and reliability plan should be considered separately; self-built services address the needs of Kubernetes Service application network access, stability and reliability should be largely adjusted. |
| Cost performance | JD Cloud Kubernetes Service Service itself is temporarily free, and you only need to pay on demand for Virtual Machines, EIP, cloud disk service and other cloud resources created in the cluster | It needs to invest a lot in infrastructure and human resources for cluster deployment, operation and maintenance.
