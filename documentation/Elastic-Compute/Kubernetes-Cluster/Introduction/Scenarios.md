# Application Scenario

Continuous Integration and Deployment

With the aid of Kubernetes Service, container-based development & test deployment process is created, which simplifies the steps of environment construction, improves resource utilization efficiency and the speed of the deployment of development test AND reduces the cost of migration. Containers can be created and deleted quickly, which can realize rapid iterations and can significantly save the time of development, testing and deployment.

Microservice Architecture

Container is the “natural” carrier for microservice architecture. With the aid of Kubernetes Service, container’s features - lightweight and unified deployment - bring a new thinking for solving the unified management, scheduling and deployment of each microservice AND greatly reduce the dependency relationship between service and version, which allows the same microservice to maintain good consistency under different environments.

Rapid Auto Scaling

Through Kubernetes Services, with the aid of container’s ability regarding quick start, quick deployment and massive concurrency, for the application whose change of demand is large and which requires to quickly start hundreds or even thousands of machines, Kubernetes Services can admirably fulfill the sudden requirements of business.
