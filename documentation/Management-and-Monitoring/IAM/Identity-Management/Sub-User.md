# What is a sub-user
A sub-user is an identity in Identity and Access Management (IAM), and each sub-user corresponds to a certain personal entity, such as an enterprise’s technical staff, operation and maintenance personnel, etc. This document describes how to create and manage a subaccount, and how to use the subaccount to log in the console for operation.

# Create subaccounts
Log in JD Cloud Console, enter Identity and Access Management > User Management, and click the【Create】 button to fill in the subaccount information in the subaccount create window:

 - The subaccount login name supports 4-20 digits of letters, Chinese characters or numbers, and a hyphen “-” and an underline “_”;
 - The subaccount password is 6-20 digits in length and must contain one of the English letters and numbers or symbols (without spaces).
