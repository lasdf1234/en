## Applicable Scenarios

The Cloud Monitor provides you with rich customer scenarios:

## Daily Workload Monitoring Management
If users need to monitor their own business, they are allowed to monitor the running status and usage of resources through the monitoring pages of the purchased Cloud Service details pages and the monitoring pages of the Cloud Monitor module. At the same time, users are allowed to set alarm rules according to the characteristics of cloud resources. When the monitoring indicator of the resource reaches the alarm threshold set by the users, an alarm is triggered, and a short message and an email alarm are sent to remind the user according to the contact information set by the user.
