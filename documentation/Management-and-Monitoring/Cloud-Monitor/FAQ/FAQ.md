   A: Enter the JD Cloud Console - Cloud Monitor menu, and the monitoring list of each resource can be seen, click on the “Monitoring Table” in the operation column of each instance, select the custom time query on this page, select start time and end time to determine the specified date range for query.

**4.Q: How is the alarm rule implemented?**

   A: Once the monitoring rules are met, the system immediately notifies the contact. The alarm notification interval is 24 hours. If the alarm is continuous within 24 hours, the alarm notification will be sent again after 24 hours; if it is not met, the alarm notification will not be sent again. In the alarm notification, the system will inform you the triggered Monitoring Rules Items and the Threshold you set.
