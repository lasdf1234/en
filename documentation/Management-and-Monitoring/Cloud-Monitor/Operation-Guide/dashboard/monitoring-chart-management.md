## Manage Monitoring Graph
### Graph Configuration Item Description
#### Graph Type
Currently, the Dashboard supports two display types, i.e. a line graph and a TopN form.

**Line Graph:** Meets most of the user's monitoring needs. Display in time sequence. For example, the CPU usage of all VM instances under a certain label changes from 13:00 to 15:001 on the same day. A line graph can add multiple monitoring items.

**TopN form: ** Real-time display of Monitoring Item data values from large to small. For example, the CPU usage of all VM instances under a label is sorted from large to small. Only one Monitoring Item can be added to the TopN form.

#### View Dimension
The data presentation dimensions currently supported by the dashboard include Details and Summary.

**Details:** A Monitoring Item for a Cloud Resource is a data line. Display multiple Cloud Resources and all corresponding Monitoring Items in the same graph. The number of data lines in the graph is equal to the number of cloud resources being monitored multiplied by the number of monitoring items.

**Summary:** The same Monitoring Items for multiple Cloud Resources are aggregated into one data line. Display summary data for multiple Monitoring Items in the same graph. The number of data lines in the icon is equal to the number of monitored items monitored. The aggregation methods include: maximum, minimum and average

#### Advanced Configuration
After setting the advanced configuration, all the resources in the selected dimension, including the monitoring data of the newly added resources, will be displayed directly in the graph without manual addition.
Currently, the advanced configuration only has labels. The label only supports "VM", "Cloud Disk Service" and "Cloud Database-SQLSERVER". If the product type is selected as other resources, there is no advanced configuration option.
