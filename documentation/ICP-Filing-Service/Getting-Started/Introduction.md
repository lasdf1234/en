# **Introduction of Filing**

Website filing is the record of reporting events pointing to competent authorities, which is used for inspection and investigation. From the perspective of administrative law, the provisions from the Legislation Law and the Ordinance on the Archivist Filing of Regulations and Government Rules are mainly used in practice. The purpose of website filing is to prevent illegal website operations on the Internet and to prevent the spread of bad Internet information. If the website is not filed, it will be intercepted.
