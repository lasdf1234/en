## **IV. How Do We Protect and Save Your Personal Information**

​        (I) Our technology and measures to protect your personal information

​         JD's network service adopts encryption technologies such as the transport layer security protocol, and provides browsing services through https and with other methods to ensure the security of user data in the transmission process.

​         JD uses encryption technologies to encrypt and save users' personal information and isolate it through the isolation technology.

​         JD uses strict data access authority control and multiple identity authentication technologies to protect personal information and prevent data from being used in violation.          JD uses automatic code security inspection and data access log analysis technology to conduct personal information security audit.

​         2. Other security measures taken by JD to protect personal information

​         JD manages and regulates the storage and use of personal information by establishing data classification and grading systems, data security management specifications, and data security development specifications.

​         JD conducts comprehensive security control of data through information contact confidentiality agreements, monitoring and auditing mechanisms.
