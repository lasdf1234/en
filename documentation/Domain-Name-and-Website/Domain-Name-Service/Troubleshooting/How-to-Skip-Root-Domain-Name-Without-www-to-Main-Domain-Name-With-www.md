# How to Skip Root Domain Name without www to Main Domain Name with www

1. Resolve jdcloud.com to the same ip as www.jdcloud.com;

2. Create a new .htaccess file, add the following code, save it and upload it to the website;

Code:

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^blog.jdcloud.com [NC]

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.jdcloud.com/$1 [L,R=301]

Enter jdcloud.com in your browser and immediately jump to www.jdcloud.com, succeed!

When your website is doing domain name resolution, is there a domain name without www? A domain name without www shall be set. Therefore, when users use a domain name without www, they can access your website normally.

However, we often encounter this situation. When other websites link to your site, they will use the following link:

www.jdcloud.com

jdcloud.com/

www.example.om/index.html

jdcloud.com/index.html

Under this condition, the pr value of your site's primary domain is spread to several other URLs. Because for search engine, the URLs with and without www are two different URLs. When they point to the same website, the search engine does not know which URL should be selected as the main.

If you use 301 redirect to transfer several other URLs such as jdcloud.com to www.jdcloud.com, PR will focus on the main domain name: www.jdcloud.com.

Although in the google webmaster center, you can set preferred domain name on google, this setting is prepared for the problem that some people cannot set the 301. Setting the preferred domain name and setting 301 have the same effect, but this is only valid for google. The setting of 301 is necessary, after all, it is suitable for all search engines.

The Difference Between Url Forwarding and 301 Redirect

After testing, it was discovered that the concepts of URL forwarding, domain name binding, 301 permanent redirect, 302 temporary redirect and meta forwarding are different.

URL forwarding: including explicit and implicit forwarding, if you do SEO, the latter is directly K. The following URL forwarding generally refers to explicit forwarding.

There is a saying that URL forwarding is not conducive to SEO, with no delivery to PR; 301 is very friendly to SEO, and can deliver PR. However, some URL forwarding tests return a code of 301, which will be mentioned below.

URL forwarding has redirected the new domain name for the existing URL. The 301 redirect is generally only valid for the home page via using code. Although htaccess can realize the target, it does not supported by win. The best way is to have redirect in the IIS console (the effect is not tested), or htaccess support (using a regular expression to achieve the corresponding redirect of each path, equivalent to replacement of the domain name)

Difference Between 301 Direct and 302 Direct

After implementing 301, the new URL completely inherits the old URL, and the ranking of the old URL is completely cleared.

After implementing 302, there is no impact on the old URL, but the new URL will not be ranked.

For 302, Even the website is not spam objectively, it is easy to be punished by the search engine because it is misjudged as spam.

meta fresh: It is specifically to redirect to a new webpage after a certain time through the meta command in the webpage. If the delay time is too short (about 5 seconds), it will be judged as spam.

Specific Method for 301 Redirect

1. set the .htaccess file (only for linux systems, requiring virtual machine support.)

When visiting jdcloud.com/, it will automatically go to www.jdcloud.com

It is necessary to write the following code in the .htaccess file.

RewriteEngine on

RewriteCond %{http_host}^jdcloud.com [NC]

RewriteRule ^(.*)$http://www.jdcloud.com/$1 [L,R=301]

Note: URL-standardized 301 redirect (above code) need to be written before other URL-rewrite code.

2. Applicable to the users who use Unix system

Use this command to notify the spider of search engine that your site file is not under this address. This is the a common method.

e.g.: Redirect 301 / http://www.jdcloud.com

3. Applicable to the users who use Windows system

Set the url forwarding on the domain name management backstage, write jdcloud.com without www, and write the www.jdcloud.com domain name with www in the latter column, then set explicit forwarding. Explicit forwarding is equivalent to 301, and implicit forwarding is equivalent to 302, which is dangerous.

However, it is worth mentioning that because the concepts of URL forwarding and 301 are different, not all explicit forwarding is 301 (it is said that the url forwarding provided by WanNet is 302); You can the website Header information query tool provided by http://tool.alimama.com/tools.php to search jdcloud.com, if the returned contains "HTTP/1.1 301Moved Permanently". Congratulations, it is 301. Mine is Xinnet, the url explicit forwarding provided by Xinnet is 301, I used this method.

If yours is WanNet on a windows machine, you should use the DNS alias resolution.

4. Use ASP / PHP to achieve 301 redirect:

ASP：

Response.Status=”301 MovedPermanently”

Response.AddHeader”Location”,”http://www.jdcloud.com/”

Response.End

PHP：

header(“HTTP/1.1 301 MovedPermanently”)；

header(“Location：http://www.jdcloud.com/”)；

exit()；

1. Redirect jdcloud.com to www.jdcloud.com

This kind of redirect is designed to make the domain name unique, which is must be done by the website SEO. The following redirect www.jdcloud.com to jdcloud.com are also for the same reason, but in different forms.

Open the .htaccess file and add the following rules. (The following rules are for the main domain name, the sub-domain name should be modified)

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.jdcloud.com$[NC]

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.jdcloud.com/$1[L,R=301]

2. Redirect www.jdcloud.com to jdcloud.com

RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^jdcloud.com$[NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://jdcloud.com/$1[L,R=301]

3. Redirect oldjdcloud.com to www.newjdcloud.com

RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !oldjdcloud.com$[NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.newjdcloud.com/$1[L,R=301]

4. Redirect oldjdcloud.com to newjdcloud.com

RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !oldjdcloud.com$[NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://newjdcloud.com/$1[L,R=301]

5. Redirect jdcloud.com/file/file.php to otherjdcloud.com/otherfile/other.php

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.jdcloud.com$ RewriteRule ^file/file.php$http://www.otherjdcloud.com/otherfile/other.php [R=301,L]

If you use 301 redirect to transfer several other URLs like jdcloud.com

www.jdcloud.com

PR is also concentrated on the main domain name: www.jdcloud.com.

Although in the google webmaster center, you can set preferred domain name on google, this setting is prepared for the problem that some people cannot set the 301. Setting the preferred domain name and setting 301 have the same effect, but this is only valid for google. The setting of 301 is necessary, after all, it is suitable for all search engines.
