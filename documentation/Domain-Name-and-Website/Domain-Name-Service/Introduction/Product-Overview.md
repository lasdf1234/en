## Domain Name

There are millions of machines on the Internet. To differentiate these machines, each machine is assigned an IP address. However, because the IP address has no practical meaning, it is difficult to remember, so there is the domain name.
The domain name is mainly composed of English letters, Arabic numerals, "-", ".", etc., in order to facilitate the memory and communication of a set of server addresses (website, email, FTP, etc.).
The domain name and the IP address are corresponded to each other. On the Internet, there is a DNS (Domain Name Server) to convert the domain name and IP. You enter the domain name on the browser, and the DNS will convert the domain name and IP to find the corresponding server, then open the corresponding web page.
To establish  server publishing information on the Internet, you must first register the corresponding domain name. Domain name registration is the basis for establishing services on the Internet. Since the registration of domain names follows the principle of “first apply for registration first”, the registration of each domain name in the Chinese Library is unique and non-repeatable. If you want to use your server to publish information, you need to register the domain name as soon as possible.
