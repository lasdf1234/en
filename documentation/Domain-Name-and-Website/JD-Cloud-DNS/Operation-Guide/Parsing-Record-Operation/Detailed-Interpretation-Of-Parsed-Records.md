Domain Name Format:

1. Legal characters: az, AZ, 0-9, '-', '.', where '-' (connector) can not be at the beginning, and can not be adjacent to '.'. The domain name can contain Chinese characters. The Chinese domain name must contain at least one Chinese character (Simplified or Traditional) in addition to the legal character of the English domain name. The character length of Chinese domain name is based on the converted Punycode code.

2. Length limit: The '.' interval is up to 63 bytes, and the overall length of domain name is up to 253 bytes (with no '.' at the end). Chinese domain names will be limited in length after Punycode transcoding.

Host Record Format:

1. Legal characters: az, AZ, 0-9, '-', '_', '.', '*', '@', 'Chinese characters'. Among them, * is used for extensive resolution and can only be used as the first character, and can only be adjacent to '.' rather than other characters, if not configurable: *a.mydnstest01.top;@, indicating the main domain name; '-' (connector) , can not be used at the beginning, and can not be adjacent to '.', if not configurable: -a.mydnstest01.top.

2. Length limit: the host record length limit depends on the length of the main domain name, and the full-qualified domain name is up to 253 bytes (with no '.' at the end), specifically, "host record length + domain name main length" does not exceed 253 bytes.
