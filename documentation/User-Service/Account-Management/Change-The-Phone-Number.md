# How to modify the binding mobile of the account
There are two types of binding mobile information in your account:
 - The first type: as an account of JD Group, the binding mobile number can be used to find back the account password or used by the user to login the websites of JD Group, including JD Mall and JD Cloud.
 - The second type: as an account activated by JD Cloud, the JD Cloud verification of mobile number is set for this account when activated and is used to receive business information and verification message from JD Cloud.

On JD Cloud “Account Security” page, you can modify the JD Cloud verification of mobile number or modify JD Cloud verification Email. However, you cannot modify the mobile number or Email used to log in your account.
