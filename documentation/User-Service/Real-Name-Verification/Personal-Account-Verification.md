In such case,

 1. If you have never used this certificate to perform personal real-name verification for any JD Group account, please click “Get Back by Appealing” and submit an appeal application;
    
 2. If your JD Cloud account is an enterprise account, please perform enterprise real-name verification to avoid possible account ownership disputes; and

 3. If you confirm that you have performed personal real-name verification on any website of JD Group, and you remember information on the verified account, please select “Associate Verified Account”.

## Associate Verified Account

To ensure that you are the owner of the verified account, the mobile phone number of the verified account needs to be verified. After the verification, the personal real-name verification is completed. Your personal real name information will be the same as the verified account:

 - If the following notification pops up when you associate verified account, it indicates that the account with real-name verification you are trying to associate has not performed real-name verification. Please retry after reconfirming the information about the verified account by using your identity.

 - When you associate verified account, the verification fails and the following notification pops up, it indicates that you have already performed personal real-name verification for another account (that is the account shown in brackets) in JD Cloud. The personal identity information of each person can only verify one account in JD Cloud, and no repeated verification or associate is allowed.
