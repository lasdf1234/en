#Contact Management



On the Account Management > Contact Management page, you can set up the contact and contact group information for receiving message notification.



There is only one default account contact, i.e. you. The email address and mobile of the account contact can be modified on the “Account Security” page. Please refer to How to Modify the Mobile Bound to the Account for more details.

## New Contact
On the “Manage Contacts” page, you may add and manage up to 20 contacts. If a contact is set as “Primary Contact”, the service personnel of JD Cloud will make the initial contact with such contact when necessary.

You need to provide the mobile phone number and email when clicking on the “New Contact" button to add a contact. A verification code will be sent to the mobile of the new contact, which is valid for 5 minutes. Please ask the contact for the verification code to complete the verification.

The contact's email won’t be verified when adding. After the contact is added, click the prompt after the “Email” and send the email verification information for verification.


## New Contact Group
On the “Manage Groups” page, you may add and manage up to 12 contact groups.

Click on the “New Contact Group” and enter a group name to create a new contact group with no members (the number of members in the group is 0). Then you need to click "Edit" to select group members from the contact list so that the contact group can receive the message notification as normal.
