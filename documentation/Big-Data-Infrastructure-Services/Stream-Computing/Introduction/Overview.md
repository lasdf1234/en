# Production Introduction<br>
## Product Overview<br>
The business value of data is rapidly reduced with the loss of time. Therefore, it must be calculated and processed as soon as possible after the data is generated. Jingdong stream computing products are streaming big data analysis platforms running on Jingdong cloud platform, which are provided to users a tool for real-time analysis of streaming data on the cloud. <br>
Stream computing is a real-time data processing and analysis platform in a big data scenario. It supports users to compile data processing operations in SQL mode, reduces the threshold of streaming data development, and helps users quickly build stream processing applications. Stream computing supports cleaning, statistical summary, and data analysis of real-time data, automatically integrating the stream data bus as an input stream, and processed results sent to a data computing service or cloud storage for data persistence storage. <br><br>
<br>
**Real-time Data Cleaning, Statistical Summary, Data Analysis**<br>
- Providing an interactive SQL editor that supports debugging and optimization of scripts to quickly build complex stream processing applications. <br><br>

**Automatic Integration**<br>
- Seamless integration of streaming data centers and data computing services<br>
The automatic integration stream data center is used as an input stream, and the processed results are sent to the data computing service for persistence. <br><br>

**Auto Scaling**<br>
- Customize operations, calculate cluster elastic scaling<br>
Automatically expand or shrink the resources required by running a streaming application based on operation matching data throughput.
