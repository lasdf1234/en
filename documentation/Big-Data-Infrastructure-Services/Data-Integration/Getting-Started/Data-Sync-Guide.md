Enter the name and description of the synchronization task to facilitate the identification, monitoring and management of the synchronization tasks in later period.

Configure the Data-source-end and Target-side. Select the data-source-end as the output-end of the synchronization task and select data’s target-side as the input-end of the synchronization task. Synchronization task will obtain data from data-source-end and write the data into data’s target-side according to the rules configured by the user.

Click ‘Run Now’ and the current synchronization task will be saved and executed. You can view the corresponding generated instance of the synchronization task and running instance in the task list and running history. If it is only required to save this synchronization task currently, there is no need to save it. Return to the tasks list after clicking Save.

For the synchronization tasks which need to be modified and online/offline, they should still be operated in this module.
