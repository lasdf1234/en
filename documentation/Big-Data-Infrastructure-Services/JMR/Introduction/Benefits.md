## High Service Availability

By default, a highly available architecture with a three-node replica set is provided, supporting high availability and ensuring business availability.

## Data lasting

With a complete data backup mechanism, the cluster supports three copies by default. You can also create backups at any time according to business conditions. Backup files can be saved in JD Cloud object storage service without worrying about data loss.

## Safety

The instance is deployed by default in a user-defined VPC Virtual Private Cloud to ensure data security. At the same time, you can set the port access settings through the network ACL to accurately control the security from the access source.
