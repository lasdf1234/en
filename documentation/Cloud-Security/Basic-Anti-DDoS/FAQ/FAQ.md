# FAQ

** 1, Q: What is the basic protection application scenario?**

A: JD Cloud Basic Anti-DDoS is applied to attack protection scenarios with the highest attacking flow rate not exceeding 2G. Once the attack flow exceeds the basic protection capability of the machine room, the black hole will be triggered, and the black hole will be triggered to limit the IP of the black hole for a certain period of time.

** 2, Q: How do I start the basic protection?**

A: The basic protection does not need to be started. As long as the public network IP of JD Cloud is purchased, the DDos defense is automatically opened for each public network IP, and the defense bandwidth of 2G is provided.

** 3, Q: How to close the basic protection?**

A: The DDos basic protection is automatic opened and cannot be closed. The Basic Anti-DDoS protects your public network IP from DDos and does not have any impact on normal business access.

* * 4, Q: What are the requirements for the defense's public network IP?**

A: Basic protection can only defend the domain name that has been filed. If the domain name is not filed, the defense will be stopped immediately, and the warning notification will be sent.

** # 5, Q: How long will it take to trigger a black hole state?**

A: The residence time of the public network IP triggering a black hole state in a black hole is at least 60 minutes, during which the IP of the public network is still monitored. Once more than the machine room foundation is monitored again
  Protects flow attacks, and the black hole time is extended by 60 minutes at the last time the attack was monitored.
  
* * 6, Q: How does the attack flow exceed 2g?**

A: The black hole is triggered when the attack exceeds 2G, and the access to the IP is shielded for a period of time. It is recommended that you purchase JD Cloud [Advanced Anti-DDoS] (https://www.jdcloud.com/products/ipanti) services from JD Cloud for greater defense.

** 7, Q: What attack types are supported for underlying protection **

A: Include and are not limited to SYN Flood, ACK Floods, TCP Floods, UDP Flood, DNS reflection attacks, NTP reflection attacks, SSDP reflection attacks, and other common attacks.
