The field of rule configuration section is explained as follows:
- Domain: Supports configuration of multi-level domain, including support for extensive domain name.
- Protocol type: Supports both HTTP and HTTPS, and can be selected according to the site protocol. When you select the HTTPS protocol, you will be asked to submit the certificate by the system. The protection takes effect only when the certificate is successfully submitted. If you need websocket protocol access, please turn on the websocket switch.
- Back-to-source method: You can select either the back-to-source IP or the back-to-source domain. The back-to-source IP (inside cloud + outside cloud) supports 20 IP addresses, and one back-to-source domain. The domain name of source station cannot be the same as the protection domain name; the source station IP is not allowed to be an Intranet address.
If the HTTP back-to-source is turned on, all protocols returning to the source station will be all converted to the HTTP protocol.
- The rules of web-based source station port support 80 and 443 ports by default. Custom port is allowed. HTTP and HTTPS protocols respectively support customizing 5 different ports.
- Standby IP is not mandatory. If the standby IP is configured, the cname will point to it in normal status. It is recommended that the standby IP be the IP of the daily external display, and the back-to-source IP be non-external. Configuring a standby IP ensures higher availability of the source station.
