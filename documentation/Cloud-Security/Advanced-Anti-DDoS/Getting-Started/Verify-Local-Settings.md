# Verify Configuration

This step ** is not mandatory ** 
<Br/>But to maximize the stability of your business, we recommend that you conduct a local test before you modify DNS resolution.

## Precondition
- The advanced anti-DDoS has been successfully purchased, the billing status is normal, and the forwarding rules have been well configured.

## Local Test Procedures
1. Log in to any one Linux server
2. Enter the following contents at the command line:
curl -x cname:port DomainName
<Br/>E.g.: <Br/>
![Verify Configuration] (https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Advanced%20Anti-DDoS/Verify-Local-Settings.png)
<Br/>If you return to the page contents of access domain, it indicates that the configuration is successfully made.
