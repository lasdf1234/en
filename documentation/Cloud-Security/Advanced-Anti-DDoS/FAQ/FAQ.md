# Frequently Questions

**Q: The IP access of which regions is supported by advanced anti-DDoS?**

A: Advanced anti-DDoS supports IP access of all regions, including JD Cloud and users outside the Cloud.

**Q: Which forwarding protocols does advanced anti-DDoS support?**

A: Advanced anti-DDoS supports the configuration of forwarding protocols including TCP, UDP, HTTP and HTTPS, and supports websocket protocol access, covering all business scenarios.

**Q: What are the differences between non-web-based forwarding and web-based forwarding?**

A: The two forwarding configurations correspond to different application scenarios and usage protocols. Specific differences are as follows:
- Non-web-based: Mainly applied to business scenarios such as games, e-commerce, finance, APP, etc.; supported protocols: TCP protocol and UDP protocol.

Provides 3 to 4 layers of SYN Flood, ACK Floods, ICMP Flood, UDP Flood, NTP Floods, SSDP Flood and other attacks protection. The DDoS protection for application layer is not supported.
- Web-based: Mainly applied to web-based business. Supported protocols: http/https protocol; supports websocket access, port accesses of 80 and 443, and non-standard port access.

In addition to providing SYN Flood, ACK Floods, ICMP Flood, UDP Flood, NTP Floods, SSDP Flood and other attacks protection, it also supports application-layer protection against attacks such as CC attacks, HTTP Flood, etc.

**Q: What IP providers does advanced anti-DDoS support?**

A: Advanced anti-DDoS supports single-line and multiple-line IP provider purchase, and supports the single-line IP provider to upgrade to multi-line IP provider.
- Single-line: The China Telecom Line can support up to 400G of protection bandwidth.

- Multi-line: Multi-line has two optional lines: Telecom + Unicom and Telecom + Unicom +CMCC, supporting up to 400G of protection bandwidth.

By default, the China Telecom Line will be resolved to the China Telecom Machine Room, the China Unicom Line to the China Unicom Machine Room, and the CMCC Line to the CMCC Machine Room. If the attack traffic exceeds the maximum capacity of China Unicom Machine Room or CMCC Machine Room, the line will be resolved to the China Telecom Line to complete the cleaning.


**Q: Does advanced anti-DDoS support extensive domains?**

A: In Web-based forwarding rules configuration of advanced anti-DDoS, it supports the protection of the extensive domains.

Extensive domain name resolution refers to the use of wildcard (*) as secondary domain name to enable all secondary domain names to point to the same IP. For example, it supports configurating *.jdcloud.com.


**Q: What is business bandwidth, and what happens it is exceeded?**

A: Business bandwidth purchased by advanced anti-DDoS is for the entire instance, meaning the bandwidth in the IN or OUT direction of all normal traffic for the instance.

In default, advanced anti-DDoS gifts 100M business bandwidth, and if it is exceeded, it would trigger traffic speed limit, which may lead to random data loss. If the bandwidth goes beyond the business bandwidth, the system will send alarm notification and recommend you upgrade it timely.

**Q: What are the requirements for access to domains of advanced anti-DDoS?**

A: According to relevant laws and regulations of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, advanced anti-DDoS only protects filed domains. If the domain is not filed, the advanced anti-DDoS service will not be available.

**Q: What is the main business of CC protection?**

A: CC protection is mainly for web-based business, and is closed by default. CC protection does not take effect when closed.

After turning on the main switch, all the domains of this instance will turn on CC protection, and you can manually close the domains that do not require CC protection.

**Q: Why would a black hole occur?**

A: When the attack traffic reaches the upper limit of the advanced anti-DDoS package that you purchase, a black hole will be triggered and shield all access to the server.

It is recommended that you buy a better protection packages for greater protection. After the package has been upgraded, the system will automatically become unbanned in seconds.

**Q: How long will the black hole be lasting, and how to unban it?**

A: By default of the black hole policy of advanced anti-DDoS, it would last for 2 hours. If the server has not been attacked in 2 hours, it will automatically become unbanned.

The duration before the server is unbanned is related to the number of times the black hole is triggered and the peak value of the attack. If the server continues to receive attack, the duration of the ban will continue to lengthen.

If the attack traffic so excessive that the operator's ban is triggered, the duration of the ban is determined by the operator's policy and becomes uncertain.

**Q: What error status codes does advanced protection support?**

A: Advanced protection sets up error code pages for the following special cases, and you can view and troubleshoot the problems according to the prompt on the page .

| 错误码	| 含义	| 出现原因 | 该怎么办 |

** Q: What is standby IP? What's the benefit of configuring a standby IP?**

A: The standby IP is the standby to the back-to-source IP. The definitions are as follows:

Back-to-source IP: Refers to the back-to-source address of advanced protection in case of attacks, which can be an IP address or a domain. It is recommended that the back-to-source IP be externally invisible.

Standby IP: Refers to the back-to-source IP address of advanced protection in case of non-attack state. It is a externally visible standby IP. Standby IP is not mandatory.

The benefits of configuring standby IP are:
- When the user's normality is not at the advanced protection, the traffic will reach the standby IP address. When the normality is ensured, the service delay will be lower and the access will be faster; Only when attacked will JD Cloud Intelligent Dispatching Center dispatch traffic to advanced protection for filter and cleaning, before forwarding clean traffic to the source station.
- The IP of normal use is separated from the back-to-source IP. This effectively improves the user's business availability.

As an example of non-web-based configuration, the schematic diagram is as follows:

**Q: Does advanced anti-DDoS support non-80-port website access?**

A: It supports. Advanced anti-DDoS supports custom port to meet access requirements for the non-standard-port web-based business.

**Q: What is an HTTP back-to-source?**

A: As shown in the figure below, after the HTTP back-to-source is turned on, it returns to server via advanced anti-DDoS and will be translated into the protocol back-to-source of HTTP. The back-to-source port used by default is 80.

If the port is customized by HTTP, the port back-to-source of custom port will be used.
