           It provides static local acceleration and dynamic optimization of the source acceleration service for the user origin server to further enhance the user access experience. If encountering DDoS attacks, any CDN acceleration node on the entire network can collaborate with the anti-D nodes in the network in real time to achieve the attack traffic traction and normal back-to-source and ensure that the continuity of user services will not be affected by DDoS attacks. After the attack is alleviated or stopped, it can be dynamically dispatched to the optimal CDN node to protect the user experience and achieve full user perception.
