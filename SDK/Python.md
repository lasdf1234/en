
# Introduction #
  Welcome to the JD Cloud Developer Python Tool Kit (Python SDK). With the JD Cloud Python SDK, you can access various services from JD Cloud without complex programming. 

  To conveniently understand the meaning of some of the concepts and parameters in the SDK, we recommend that you review the OpenAPI to use the Getting Started document before using the SDK. To understand the specific parameters and meanings of each API, refer to the program comments or documentation for specific product lines under OpenAPI&SDK.

# Environment Preparation #

1. The JD Cloud Python SDK is suitable for Python 2.7. * and 3. * Version.
2. To apply the accesskey and the secretKey (AK/SK) in advance in the AccessKey Management page under the Account Management of JD Cloud User Center before starting to call the JD Cloud open API. AK/SK information shall be kept properly and if lost, it is likely to cause illegal users to use this information to operate your resources on the cloud, resulting data or property losses.

# SDK usage method #
It is recommended to install the JD Cloud Python SDK using pip as follows:

	pip install -U jdcloud_sdk
You can also download the sdk source code for its own use.

Using the source code to install as follows:

	python setup.py install
 
With any of the problems in the SDK use, you welcome you to communicate with the Github project[SDK Use Problem Feedback page](https://github.com/jdcloud-api/jdcloud-sdk-python/issues).

**Note: JD Cloud does not provide other downloading methods. Please be sure to use the above-mentioned official download method!**
 
Call SDK
The calling of the Python SDK is mainly divided into four steps:

1. Set accessKey and secretKey
2. Create Client
3. Set Request Parameters
4. Response to implementation requests

The following is an example of a call to query the cloud host instance type

```python
from jdcloud_sdk.core.credential import Credential
from jdcloud_sdk.services.vm.client.VmClient import VmClient
from jdcloud_sdk.services.vm.apis.DescribeInstanceTypesRequest \
    import DescribeInstanceTypesParameters, DescribeInstanceTypesRequest 

access_key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
secret_key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
credential = Credential(access_key, secret_key)
client = VmClient(credential)

try:
    parameters = DescribeInstanceTypesParameters('cn-north-1')
    request = DescribeInstanceTypesRequest(parameters)
    resp = client.send(request)
    if resp.error is not None:
        print resp.error.code, resp.error.message
        return
    print resp.result
except Exception, e:
    print e
    #错误处理
```

If you need to set up an additional header, for example to call an interface that opens the MFA operation protection, you need to pass x-jdcloud-security-token, as follows:
```python
parameters = DeleteInstanceParameters('cn-north-1', 'i-xxx')
header = {'x-jdcloud-security-token': 'xxx'} 
request = DeleteInstanceRequest(parameters, header)
```
